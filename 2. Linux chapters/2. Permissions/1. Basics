Authentication and Authorization

Linux strictly separates authentication and authorization.

Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying identity.
In Linux, authentication can be performed using:

Passwords

SSH keys

Smart cards or digital certificates (advanced environments)

Authorization

Authorization is the process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do.

A user may successfully authenticate but still have very limited permissions. This separation is fundamental to Linux security.
