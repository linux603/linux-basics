 what is Linux User Management ?
 ===============================

Linux is designed as a multi-user operating system. From the beginning, Linux assumes that multiple users, services, and processes will exist on the same system at the same time. 
To make this possible safely, Linux implements user management, which is the system of defining users, groups, identities, permissions, and privileges.
User management ensures security, isolation, and accountability. Every action performed on a Linux system is associated with a user identity. There is no anonymous activity.



Users in Linux :- A user in Linux is an identity assigned to a person or a process. Each user is uniquely identified by a User ID (UID). 
                   Linux internally works with UIDs, not usernames.


Major Categories of Users in Linux:
==================================
Linux classifies users based on purpose and privilege level. Each category exists to maintain security, isolation, and control within the operating system.

There are flour major categories of users:
                                            1.Root User
                                            2.System Users
                                            3.Application users 
                                            3.Normal (Human) Users


1. Root User :  User ID = 0
============

        The root user is the superuser of the Linux system.
        It has a User ID (UID) of 0, which gives it unrestricted access to the entire operating system.

        The root user can:
        -----------------
        Read, write, and execute any file
        Modify system configuration
        Start and stop services
        Create, modify, or delete users
        Bypass all permission checks
        Root is not restricted by file permissions. Because of this power, logging in directly as root is discouraged. Instead, Linux administrators use normal users with temporary privilege elevation using sudo.
        The root account exists for system control, not daily operations.

 

2. System Users : User ID range = 1-99
================
        System users are created by the operating system to run core services and background processes.

        These users:
        -------------
        Run system services like sshd, cron, dbus
        Usually have low UID values (1-99)
        Do not have login shells
        Cannot log in interactively
        Often do not have home directories
        System users improve security by isolating services. If a service is compromised, the attacker gains access only to that limited system user, not the entire system.
        System users exist for internal system functionality, not human interaction.


3. Application Users: User ID range = 100-999
====================
        Application users are created specifically for applications installed by administrators.

        Examples include:
        nginx
        mysql
        postgres
        oracle

        These users:
        ------------
        Own application files and processes
        Run application services
        Have restricted permissions
        Usually cannot log in interactively
        Application users provide application-level isolation. Each application runs under its own user account, preventing one application from interfering with another or with the system.
        This is a critical concept in enterprise Linux administration.


4. Normal (Human) Users : User ID range = 1000-60K
=========================
        Normal users represent real people who log in and use the system.

        These users:
        ------------
        Have UIDs typically starting from 1000
        Have home directories under /home
        Have login shells such as /bin/bash
        Can log in via console or SSH

        Normal users operate with limited privileges. When administrative access is required, they use sudo rather than logging in as root.
        This separation ensures accountability and prevents accidental system damage.


 User Database Files and Access Control in Linux :
 ==================================================
 Linux stores all user and group information in plain-text configuration files. These files act as the user database of the operating system. 
 Understanding these files is essential for Linux administrators because authentication, authorization, and access control all depend on them.

 ---> /etc/passwd — User Account Information File :
 --------------------------------------------------
The /etc/passwd file stores basic information about every user account on the system.
It is readable by all users, but it does not store passwords, which is an important security design.

Each line in /etc/passwd represents one user account and contains the following fields:
Username – the login name of the user
UID (User ID) – a unique numeric identifier used internally by Linux
Primary GID (Group ID) – the user’s main group
Home directory – the user’s default working directory
Default shell – the program started when the user logs in
Linux uses this file to map usernames to UIDs, because internally Linux recognizes users only by UID, not by name.

---> /etc/shadow — Secure Password Information
The /etc/shadow file stores encrypted (hashed) passwords and password aging policies.

Key characteristics:
Only readable by the root user
Contains password hashes, not plaintext passwords
Stores information such as password expiration and account lock status
Separating password data from /etc/passwd significantly improves security by preventing unauthorized users from accessing password hashes.

---> /etc/group — Group Information File
-----------------------------------------
The /etc/group file defines groups and group membership.

Groups are used to:
-------------------
Assign permissions to multiple users at once
Simplify administration
Enforce role-based access control
Each group has:
A group name
A Group ID (GID)
A list of users who are members of that group
