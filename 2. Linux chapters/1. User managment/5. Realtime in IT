 Real-Time User Management Example in an IT Company
 ==================================================

Consider a mid-size IT company called ABC Technologies.
The company has:
                500 employees
                Development, QA, DevOps, HR, and Finance teams
                Hundreds of Linux servers (on-prem + cloud)
                Strict security and audit requirements


 Scenario 1: Local User Management (Small Team / Early Stage)

 Company Situation : When ABC Technologies started, it had:
                                                            5 employees
                                                            2 Linux servers
                                                            No dedicated IT security team
                                                            Each server was managed individually.


How User Management Worked :
                            The Linux admin created users locally on each server
                            User accounts were stored in:
                            `/etc/passwd`
                            `/etc/shadow`
                            `/etc/group`
                            Developers logged in using SSH keys
                            Permissions were managed per server

                            Example:
                            Developer Ravi had an account on:
                            `dev-server`
                            `test-server`
                            Ravi had separate user entries on each server



 Problems as the Company Grew,  As ABC Technologies expanded :
                                                                User creation had to be repeated on every server
 If Ravi left the company:
                            His account had to be deleted from every server
                            Password policies became inconsistent
                            Auditing user access took too much time
                            Local user management became unmanageable at scale.



 Scenario 2: Centralized User Management (Enterprise Scale)

 Company Situation Now ABC Technologies has:
                                                500 employees
                                                200+ Linux servers
                                                Compliance requirements (ISO, SOC2)
So, hey move to centralized user management.


Centralized Solution Used now 
The company deploys:
                    Active Directory (AD) or FreeIPA / LDAP
                    Redundant identity servers
                    Linux systems integrated using SSSD + PAM

 How It Works in Real Time
1. HR creates a new employee record
2. IT creates one user account in AD/LDAP
3. User is added to groups:
    `developers`
    `qa`
    `devops`
4. Group policies define access
Now the same user can:
 Log in to email
 Access VPN
 SSH into Linux servers
 Access internal tools

One identity, many systems

Example: Developer Login Flow
When Ravi logs in to a Linux server:
1. Ravi enters SSH credentials
2. Linux server contacts LDAP/AD
3. Credentials are verified centrally
4. Group membership is checked
5. Access is granted or denied

No local user entry is required.


 Scenario 3: Employee Exit (Very Important)

 Without Centralized Management Admin must remove user from:
                                                            200 servers
                                                            High risk of missing a server
                                                            Security risk
 With Centralized Management :
                            Admin disables the account once
                            Access is revoked everywhere instantly
                            Audit logs remain intact

This is a major security and compliance requirement.

 Service Account Management in IT Companies 

 What Is a Service Account A service account is a non-human user account created to run applications, services, or automated processes.

Unlike normal users:
                    Service accounts are not used for interactive login
                    They are used by applications, jobs, and background services
                    They exist to allow software to authenticate securely

In simple words:
                > Humans use normal accounts.
                > Applications use service accounts.



 Why Service Accounts Are Needed ?

In an IT company, applications must:
                                    Access databases
                                    Read/write files
                                    Communicate with other services
                                    Run scheduled jobs
                                    Start automatically after reboot

Applications cannot use human accounts because:
                                                Human passwords change
                                                Employees leave the company
                                                Human access is unpredictable

Service accounts provide stability, security, and automation.



 Real-Time Example: IT Company Scenario

 Company Environment

A company runs:
                Web applications
                Databases
                CI/CD pipelines
                Monitoring tools
                Backup systems
Each component runs using its own service account.


 Example 1: Web Application

A web application called PayrollApp runs on a Linux server.

Service account:
                Username: `payrollsvc`
                Purpose: Run the Payroll application

What it can do:
                Read application files
                Write logs
                Connect to the payroll database

What it cannot do:
                Log in via SSH
                Use sudo
                Access other applications

 Example 2: Database Service

A database service like MySQL runs as:
                                        Service account: `mysql`
Why:
 Database files belong only to `mysql`
 No other user can access raw data
 Database processes are isolated


Service accounts can be managed in two ways, depending on company size.

 1. Local Service Accounts (Linux Level)

Used for:
 System services
 Single-server applications

Characteristics:
 Created locally
 No login shell
 No password login
 Restricted permissions

They appear in:
 `/etc/passwd`
 `/etc/group`

These accounts run services via `systemd`.



 2. Centralized Service Accounts (Enterprise Level)
Used for:
 Applications spanning multiple servers
 Cloud and enterprise environments

Managed in:
 Active Directory
 LDAP / FreeIPA
 Cloud IAM (AWS IAM, GCP Service Accounts, Azure AD)

Advantages:
 Central password/key rotation
 Easy auditing
 Consistent identity across systems
