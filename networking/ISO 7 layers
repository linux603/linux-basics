 OSI Model – 7 Layers

The OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection) divides network communication into 7 layers. Each layer has a specific role.

---

 1️⃣ Physical Layer (Layer 1)

 What it does: Transmits raw bits over physical media.
 Examples: Ethernet cables, fiber, NIC, hubs, switches (hardware level) at electrical level.
 Linux Admin Role: Check NIC, cables, link lights, `ethtool eth0'

Layman Meaning: The cables and hardware that carry electricity or light to send data.
IT Meaning: Sends raw bits (0s and 1s) over physical media.



---

 2️⃣ Data Link Layer (Layer 2)

 What it does: Packages bits into frames, uses MAC addresses for delivery inside LAN.
 Examples: Switches, VLANs, MAC addresses
 Linux Admin Role: Check MAC, configure VLAN, use `ip link`, `brctl`


Layman Meaning: Like a postman in your building, delivering letters to the right apartment using MAC addresses.

IT Meaning: Packages bits into frames, uses MAC addresses, handles LAN communication.

---

 3️⃣ Network Layer (Layer 3)

 What it does: Routes packets between networks using IP addresses
 Examples: Routers, IP addressing, subnetting, routing tables
 Linux Admin Role: Check IP config, routes (`ip route`), troubleshoot connectivity

Layman Meaning: Like a city map and postal system, routing packages between buildings (networks).

IT Meaning: Routes packets between networks using IP addresses.

---

 4️⃣ Transport Layer (Layer 4)

 What it does: Provides end-to-end communication, ensures data delivery
 Examples: TCP, UDP, ports
 Linux Admin Role: Check active ports, TCP/UDP services, `netstat`, `ss`, `telnet`

Layman Meaning: Like a courier service that ensures delivery, ensures packages arrive complete and in order.

IT Meaning: Provides end-to-end communication, ensures reliability using TCP/UDP.

---

 5️⃣ Session Layer (Layer 5)

 What it does: Manages sessions / connections between applications
 Examples: SSH, NFS, FTP sessions
 Linux Admin Role: Monitor session connections, logins, and active sessions

Layman Meaning: Like a session manager at a hotel, keeping track of which rooms are active and who’s connected.

IT Meaning: Manages sessions or connections between applications.

---

 6️⃣ Presentation Layer (Layer 6)

 What it does: Formats / encrypts data for the application
 Examples: SSL/TLS, encryption, compression, character encoding
 Linux Admin Role: Configure SSL/TLS for services, check certificates

Layman Meaning: Like a translator, converting data into a format the receiver can understand.

IT Meaning: Formats, encrypts, or compresses data for applications.

---

 7️⃣ Application Layer (Layer 7)

 What it does: Interface between network and user applications
 Examples: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS
 Linux Admin Role: Manage services (Apache, Nginx, Samba, DNS), troubleshoot application access

Layman Meaning: Like a shopkeeper, directly serving customers and providing services.

IT Meaning: Provides network services to end-users.

 Mnemonic to Remember the 7 Layers

```
All People Seem To Need Data Processing

 A → Application
 P → Presentation
 S → Session
 T → Transport
 N → Network
 D → Data Link
 P → Physical
