Netstat or ss:
===========

	network staticstics   ( rhel 5 & 6)
	ss  (socket staticstics) ( rhel 7 & 8 )

service will have one reserved port number
	ftp 20/21
	ssh 22
	nfs 2049

Using ss or netstat, we can check the status of network ports and see which services are listening. If a service is running correctly, its assigned port will usually be in the LISTEN state.


Below is **connection types (TCP states)** explained in the **same Linux admin notes format** you are using 👇



 Connection Types (TCP States)
================================
Connection types show the current status of a network connection
Used in netstat / ss output


 1. LISTEN
============
Service is running
Waiting to accept incoming connections

Example:
sshd listening on port 22




 2. ESTABLISHED
=================
Connection is active
Data transfer is happening


Meaning:
Client ↔ Server communication in progress




 3. SYN_SENT
==============
Client sent connection request
Waiting for server response


Occurs when:
Client initiates TCP connection




 4. SYN_RECV
==============
Server received connection request
Waiting for client acknowledgement


Occurs when:
Server is accepting new connection




 5. FIN_WAIT1
===============
Connection termination started
Local system sent FIN packet




 6. FIN_WAIT2
===============
Waiting for remote system to close




 7. CLOSE_WAIT
================
Remote system closed connection
Local system still open


Common issue:
Application not closing socket properly




 8. TIME_WAIT
===============
Connection closed
OS waiting before releasing port


Purpose:
Prevent delayed packets from corrupting new connections




 9. LAST_ACK
==============
Waiting for final acknowledgement




 10. CLOSED
=============
Connection fully terminated
No active session




 UDP Connection Type
======================
UDP is connectionless
No ESTABLISHED or LISTEN handshake


In output:
UNCONN → UDP socket active



imp::::
LISTEN       → waiting for connection
ESTABLISHED  → active connection
TIME_WAIT   → connection closing
CLOSE_WAIT  → application issue

ex:

established showning 20 that means hom many remote machines are connected? 20 servers are connected with this system.

	netstat -nap | grep :21
	netstat -nap | grep ssh

-n  → show IP addresses and port numbers in numeric format
-a  → all connections
-p  → process ID / service name
-l  → only listening services not the established
	
    netstat -nl 

	ss -nap | grep :21
	ss -nap | grep ssh
