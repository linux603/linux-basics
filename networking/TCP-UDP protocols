 TCP and UDP

These are two main protocols used to send data over a network. They sit at the Transport Layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model.

---

 1️⃣ TCP – Transmission Control Protocol

 What it is: A protocol that ensures data is sent reliably and in order.
 Layman Example: Sending a registered letter – you get confirmation when it’s delivered.
 
 IT Example:
   SSH (secure remote login)
   HTTP / HTTPS (web traffic)
   FTP (file transfer)
 Characteristics:
   Connection-oriented (establishes a connection first)
   Reliable delivery (retransmits if lost)
   Ordered packets

 2️⃣ UDP – User Datagram Protocol

 What it is: A protocol that sends data fast, but without guaranteeing delivery.
 Layman Example: Sending a postcard – it may arrive, but no confirmation.
 
 IT Example:
   DNS (domain name lookups)
   DHCP (IP assignment)
   Streaming videos / VoIP
 Characteristics:

   Connectionless (no handshake)
   No guarantee of delivery
   Fast and lightweight

| ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Reliability | ✅ Guaranteed        | ❌ Not guaranteed     |
| Order       | ✅ Packets in order  | ❌ No order guarantee |
| Connection  | Connection-oriented | Connectionless       |
| Speed       | Slower              | Faster               |
| Examples    | SSH, HTTP, FTP      | DNS, DHCP, Streaming |

Port Number


 1️⃣ What is a Port Number?

 A port number is like a door or channel on a computer that lets data from the network enter a specific service or application.
 Computers use IP addresses to find each other on a network.
 Ports tell the computer which program should handle the incoming data.

Example (Layman):

 Your house = IP address
 Doors = port numbers
 Mailman (network traffic) delivers letters to the correct door.

---

 2️⃣ Why Port Numbers Exist

1. Multiple services on one machine:

    A single server can run web server, email server, and FTP server.
    Ports separate traffic so each service gets the correct data.

2. Traffic management:

    Allows network protocols to distinguish between services (HTTP vs SSH vs DNS).

 3️⃣ Port Number Ranges

| Range       | Type              | Description                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 0–1023      | Well-known ports  | Reserved for common services (HTTP, SSH, FTP) |
| 1024–49151  | Registered ports  | Assigned to user-installed services           |
| 49152–65535 | Dynamic / Private | Used temporarily by clients                   |

 4️⃣ Common Ports

| Protocol | Port | Service     |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| TCP      | 22   | SSH         |
| TCP      | 80   | HTTP        |
| TCP      | 443  | HTTPS       |

 5️⃣ Linux Admin Role

 Check open ports: `ss -tuln` / `netstat -tuln`
 Open ports in firewall: `firewalld`, `ufw`, `iptables`
 Test connectivity: `telnet <host> <port>` or `nc -zv <host> <port>`
 Assign custom ports if needed for applications
