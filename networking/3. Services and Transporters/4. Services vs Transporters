 1️⃣ Services (OS / Application Level)

Service = a software process running on the OS that provides some functionality to users or other systems.

In Linux, services usually:

 Run in the background (daemon)
 Listen on a port
 Are managed by systemd

 
If a service is running, its port will be in LISTEN state



 2️⃣ Transporters (Transport Layer Protocols)

Transporters = Transport Layer protocols that carry data between systems.

They work below services and above the network (IP) layer

 Main Transport Protocols

 🔹 TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

 Connection-oriented
 Reliable (acknowledgement, retransmission)
 Ordered delivery


 🔹 UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

 Connectionless
 Faster but no guarantee
 No retransmission




 3️⃣ Relationship: Service vs Transporter


Application (Service) → Transport (TCP/UDP) → Network (IP)


 Example: SSH

 Service: sshd
 Transporter: TCP
 Port: 22
 Protocol Stack:


SSH → TCP → IP → Ethernet




 4️⃣ Real-World Example

When you open a website:

 Browser talks to HTTP service
 HTTP uses TCP
 TCP uses IP
 IP sends packets over the network
