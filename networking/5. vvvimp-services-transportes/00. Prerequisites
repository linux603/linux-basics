 =====================================================================================
To use any service, certain prerequisites must be met before it can function properly.
 =======================================================================================

1. Most services are installed by default on many Linux servers. If a required service is not installed, we must install it as a prerequisite before we can use
	    yum install <service.package.name

2. after installing any service, we must 
		Start the service                 = systemctl start <service>
		Enable the service at boot		  = systemctl enable <service>
		Verify the service status         = systemctl status <service>

3. Ensure the service is listening on its port
    	

	note : if the service is NOT listening, it means:
														The service is not running, or
														The service failed to start, or
														The port is changed in configuration, or
														The service is blocked by firewall or SELinux

4. if port blocked, Allow the port in the firewall
		firewall-cmd --add-port=<port>/tcp --permanent
		firewall-cmd --reload

5. Check or update the configuration file (if required)
		vi /etc/<service>/<config_file>
		systemctl restart <service>


6. Test access from client side to server side

After configuring a service, we must test connectivity from the client to the server.

If the connection is successful, everything is OK.
If it fails, we must check and fix network-level settings.


 🔹 On-Prem (Data Center)

If access fails, check:

 Firewall rules (hardware or OS firewall)
 Router / switch configuration
 VLAN / subnet routing
 Port allowed between networks

Commands:

ping server_ip
telnet server_ip port
nc -zv server_ip port


 🔹 AWS

If access fails, check:

 Security Groups (inbound rules)
 NACL (Network ACL)
 Route Table
 Public / Private IP
 Internet Gateway / NAT Gateway

Example:

 Allow port 22 / 80 / 443 in Security Group


 🔹 Azure

If access fails, check:

 Network Security Group (NSG) inbound rules
 Subnet NSG association
 Route tables (UDR)
 Public IP attached to VM
 Azure Firewall (if used)

Example:

 NSG must allow required port from source IP


 🔹 GCP

If access fails, check:

 VPC Firewall Rules
 Network tags / service accounts
 Subnet and routing
 Public IP enabled

Example:

 GCP firewall rule must allow the port and protocol


> If client access fails, we troubleshoot network-level controls like firewalls, security groups, NSGs, or VPC rules based on the environment.

Although Linux provides many services and transport protocols at the OS level, a Linux administrator is typically responsible for managing and configuring only a specific set of core services. 
These include remote access services like SSH, network services such as DNS, DHCP, NTP, file-sharing services like NFS and Samba, web services like HTTP/HTTPS, and basic mail or database services as required by the environment. 
Other services are managed by application, network, or security teams. The Linux administrator’s role is to ensure these essential services are properly installed, configured, secured, monitored, and available.
