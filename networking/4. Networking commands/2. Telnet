	in remote machine
		ssh is running  so remote machines can connect through ssh(22)
	in remote machine
		 ssh is not running then remote machines can't connect or establish connection.

	machine1
	machine2
		machine 1 want to connect to machine 2 via ssh service. so here we have see is ssh service is running machine2 . if ssh service is not running in
			machine2 then machine1 can not connect.
	
			if ssh service is running in machine2 then machine1 or any other machines connect connect with machine2.
