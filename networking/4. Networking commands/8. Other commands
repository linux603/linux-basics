1.ip (modern command – recommended)
=====================================
The ip utility is the modern networking tool in Linux, replacing legacy commands like ifconfig and route, 
and is used to manage interfaces, IP addresses, routing tables, and link status.

Common usage:
ip addr show        → show IP address
ip link show        → show network interfaces
ip route show       → show routing table
we can use also :
ip a
ip addr


Interface UP / DOWN commands :
-----------------------------
Using `ip` (recommended) Bring interface DOWN

command : ip link set eth0 down

Using `ip` (recommended) Bring interface UP

command : ip link set eth0 up


Using `ip` (recommended) Show interface state

command : ip link show eth0


States:
UP        → interface enabled
DOWN      → interface disabled



2. route (legacy)
Used to view routing table
Replaced by ip route

command : route -n

Gateway
Destination
Interface


3.ifconfig (legacy)

command : ifconfig

Older network configuration command
Deprecated but still available in some systems




4. tcpdump (packet capture)

Used to capture and analyze network packets
Very useful for troubleshooting

Common usage:
tcpdump -i eth0
tcpdump -i eth0 port 22
tcpdump -i eth0 port 53





 5. Restart network interface
 

 NetworkManager restart (all interfaces)

systemctl restart NetworkManager




 6. Assign / remove IP address (ip)


 Add IP address


ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0


 Delete IP address


ip addr del 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0




 7. Enable / Disable interface via systemd (rare)

systemctl stop NetworkManager
systemctl start NetworkManager



 8. Check cable / link status
