		IP ADDRESS
	=============================

IP = internet protocol
	ip is equal to address for your house

		192.168.145.80  address for one machine
	s/o, xxxx, house number 2, 2n street,area name,city,state-pin 560036 or 516108

			IP CLASSES
		=====================
	Class  A    = network  - computers
	Class  B   = Network - computers
	Class  C   = Network - computers
	Class  D   = multi casting network ( tv channels, live streaming)
	Class  E    = r & d ( research and dev) network

		1  to 255
ip 1 to 255

	IBM = 10 lakhs
	Accenture = 15 lakhs employess
how we can allocate 15 lakhs ips for all employees

		1.1.1.1
		1.1.1.2
		1.1.1.3
		1.1.1.255  
	
	255 * 255 * 255 * 255
				8       8         8       8      = 32 bits
		IP  V4  = 32 bits     oct1 . oct2. oct3 . oct4
		IP  V6 = 128 bits   
	
		IPV4 = 192.168.145.1
		IPV6 = 11345ABC.2342DE3D.156ABE7E.88567EG7


			IANA = Internet Assigned number authority

	1 -255
	IANA team created or catogoriged IP to public and privite



		1 -255

		public = internet
		private = personal,with in company network

								private     			Public		
			A CLASS = 1 - 126				10.*.*.*			1-9 and 11-126.*.*.*
								1*255*255*255
				127 is reserved for loop back  	
			B CLASS = 128 - 191			172.16.*.* - 172.31.*.*        	128-172 and 173 to 191
							1*15*255*255
			C CLASS =  192 - 223			192.168.*.*
								1*1*255*255
			D CLASS = 224 - 239		15*255*255*255	
			E CLASS = 240 - 255



	10.1.1.2   is it private or public?  private
	2.1.1.2  is it private or public?  public
	172.1.1.4  is it private or public? public


	Netmask values for network classes
	   network	netmask
	10.*.*.*		255.0.0.0
	172.16.*.*	255.255.0.0
	192.168.*.*         	255.255.255.0

umask is for permissions
netmask is for network IP address


		        10.h.h.h
		         n.h.h.h

		 10 as soon as it see ip address starts with 10 it(network) understands it is a A class private IP
			h.h.h = host

	192.168.h.h
	 N       N    H  H



		each and every machine will have min one ethernet netcard
	
		eth0 = MAC address  meadia access controller ( MAC means unique number of ehternet card)
		eth1 = MAC Address
		eth2 = MAC Address
	
HBA (host bus adapter) using this we can access the storage
	HBA will have one unique number, what is that ? wwn = world wide number
eth0 (ethernet card 0) also will have one unique number that is MAC address

		IP address is assigned to MAC address
		bank account is mapped with AADHAAR

***** what is the use of loop back IP?
	127.0.0.1
	
	ftp,ssh,nfs,samba,http these are all network services
		internally or within machine services will use loop back ip to connect each other
		
	if service want to go out then IP address using ehternet card

	How to assign Static IP address to ethernet card
	==================================
				
		Static IP Address      we will fix the one static ip for ehternet card
		Dynamic IP address  there will be a one dhcp server that will assign dynamic ip to ethernet card
			
			randomly ip will be assigned to ehternet cards
				today one ip eth0
				tomorrow there will be a another ip for same eth0
	there will be bunch of ip's with dhcp server
		dhcp server will allocate IP address for invidual machines
		
	which IP method is recommended for servers? Static IP

	how to get dhcp Ip for machine?
		vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens33
			BOOTPROTO=dhcp
			
		
	how to get static IP for machine?
		vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens33
			BOOTPROTO=static
			IPADDR=192.168.145.100
			NETMASK=255.255.255.0
			GATEWAY=192.168.145.1

***** how many ip address we can assign for single machine
		255
	
GATEWAY: way for network. all network systems has to use single way to go out and come inside .
		easy monitor if we maintain one gateway.	

		192.168.*.*  65000 ip's
	
		in/out   i have to keep 65000 watch mans for individual machine

suppose if i keep one main gate for all 65000 IP's then how man watch mans are required?   
			1
that 1 is nothing but gateway



***** How to assign multiple ip addresses to single ethernet card?
	vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens33
		BOOTPROTO=static
		ONBOOT=yes
		IPADDR0=192.168.145.100
		PREFIX0=24
		NETMASK0=255.255.255.0
		GATEWAY0=192.168.145.1
		IPADDR1=192.168.145.101
		PREFIX1=24
		NETMASK1=255.255.255.0
		GATEWAY1=192.168.145.1
