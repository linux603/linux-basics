 Switch



 1️⃣ Layman Meaning

 Think of a switch like a power strip for networking.
 It connects multiple computers inside the same office or building.
 Once connected, computers can talk to each other easily.

Example:

10 computers in an office
All connected to one switch
→ They can share files, printers, and applications


 2️⃣ IT / Technical Meaning

 Switch operates inside LAN (Local Area Network).
 Uses MAC addresses to send data only to the intended device.
 Does NOT connect directly to the Internet.

Key points:
 Layer 2 device (Data Link Layer)
 Forward traffic based on MAC addresses
 Can create VLANs for network segmentation
