what is netowrk? 

creating connectivity between 2 or more than 2 components to transfer data.

files,audio,video,voice

how to create connectivity or how to create network between 2 or more than 2 components?
			1. Cable
			2. wifi

Types of networks
=================
		1. intranet (LAN)
		2. Extranet (MAN)
		3. Internet  (WAN) we are using internet to connect each other

1. LAN ( Loacal area network):
   creating network between components with in building
   using cables can possible to create network between all components within building
		using below components we can create network between all the components with in building
		patch panel
		swith
		router

Layman meaning:
A LAN is like the network inside your home, office, or a school building. All computers and devices inside one building can talk to each other.

Very simple example:
You connect your laptop, printer, CCTV, and mobile to the same Wi-Fi router at home → that is a LAN.
In an office, all employees desktops are connected to one switch → LAN.

IT example:
To create a LAN in an office building:

Patch panel – wires from all rooms terminate here

Switch – connects all computers

Router – connects the LAN to the internet

Cables (Cat6/Cat5e) – carry the data

Scenario:
If 50 employees work in the same building on different floors, their systems connect through switches to form a LAN. They can share files, use a common printer, and access internal apps.

2. MAN(metropolitan area network)
	create netwrk between one building to another building
			or
	creating network between one area building to another area building with in same city

	cable
	router

Layman meaning:
This is a network that connects two or more buildings across a city.

Very simple example:
Imagine a company with:

one office in Chennai T. Nagar,
another office in Chennai Velachery

If they connect both buildings using a fiber cable → that is a MAN.


IT example:

Fiber cable or leased line provided by ISP
Routers on both sides connect the offices
Dedicated bandwidth (e.g., 100 Mbps point-to-point link)

Scenario:
A bank has 10 branches in the same city. All are connected to the head office to access centralized banking applications → this is a MAN network.

3. WAN ( wide area network)  Internet

ISP = internet service providers

Layman meaning:
WAN is the biggest network — the internet itself.
It connects cities, countries, and the whole world.

Very simple example:
When you use:
Jio / Airtel data,
Broadband at home,
Wi-Fi in a hotel,

IT example:
WAN is when:
Company offices in India, USA, UK are all connected
Using ISP services like Airtel, Vodafone, Jio, Tata

Scenario:
Amazons headquarters in the USA is connected with data centers in India, Singapore, and Europe using dedicated WAN links.


main network components :
ethernet 
switch
router
firewall

 On-Premise Example (Office)
 Ethernet → LAN port on server
 Switch → connects all office systems
 Router → connects office to ISP
 Firewall → protects office network






 On-Prem Network Architecture 


| Component                  | What it does                                       | Linux Admin Role                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Router                 | Connects different networks (LAN ↔ WAN / Internet) | Check routes, troubleshoot connectivity           |
| Switch                 | Connects multiple devices within LAN               | Verify port connectivity, VLANs                   |
| Firewall               | Controls inbound/outbound traffic                  | Check rules, open required ports                  |
| Load Balancer          | Distributes traffic to multiple servers            | Ensure backend servers healthy                    |
| DNS Server             | Resolves hostnames → IPs                           | Test/validate name resolution (`dig`, `nslookup`) |
| DHCP Server            | Dynamically assigns IPs                            | Check IP assignment for servers                   |
| Web / App / DB Servers | Hosts applications                                 | Maintain, patch, monitor services                 |
| Monitoring / Logging   | Collects metrics & logs                            | Monitor system health, alerts                     |

 2️⃣ Typical LAN / WAN Setup

 LAN (Local Area Network) → inside building
 WAN (Wide Area Network) → connects multiple offices / data centers
 DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) → public-facing servers (web, mail)

 3️⃣ Linux Admin Responsibilities (On-Prem)

 Check network interfaces:
ip a


 Verify routes:
ip route


 Test connectivity:
ping <IP>
traceroute <IP>


 Check firewall rules:
iptables -L
firewalld --list-all


 Validate DNS resolution:
dig www.example.com
nslookup www.example.com


 Ensure servers are reachable from LAN/WAN

 5️⃣ Key Concepts for Linux Admin

1. LAN vs WAN

    LAN → Local connectivity
    WAN → Connects multiple sites / Internet

2. DMZ

    Public-facing services
    Firewalled from internal network

3. Routing & Firewall

    Linux admins check connectivity between subnets
    Ensure proper routes exist and firewall allows traffic

4. DNS

    Internal / external name resolution
    Troubleshoot application access issues
