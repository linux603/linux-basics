Ethernet card :

Layman meaning:
Ethernet is the network connection that allows a computer or server to talk to other devices.

Simple example:
 Your desktop has a LAN port at the back.
 When you connect a network cable (LAN cable) → that is Ethernet.

IT meaning:
 Ethernet is a network interface (NIC) present in every server, laptop, desktop.
 It uses a MAC address to identify the device.

Where used:
 Home computer
 Office server
 Data center servers
 Cloud VMs (virtual Ethernet)

NIC (Network Interface Card) : physical (hardware) and  logical (OS level).
    Where NIC is in a Linux Server (Layman) :
    Think of a Linux server like a mobile phone:
    NIC = SIM / Wi-Fi chip
    It is the entry and exit point for network data

a.Physically
    NIC is a network card attached to the server motherboard
    It has:
    LAN port
    MAC address

    Physical Location (Hardware Level)
    On a physical server:
    NIC is:
    Built into the motherboard OR
    Installed as a PCI card
    Back side of the server (LAN cable connected)

b.Logically (Inside Linux OS)
    Linux represents NIC as a network interface
    Example names:
    eth0
    ens33/etc/netplan/
    enp0s3
    eno1
    NIC Location Inside Linux OS
    Linux sees NIC as files & interfaces
    | Kernel view (live NICs) | /sys/class/net/                 |
    | RHEL NIC config         | /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ |
    | Ubuntu NIC config       | /etc/netplan/                   |


VVVVVVVVVIMP 
 What is OS- LEVEL (EX:RHEL/Ubuntu) NIC Configuration?
    NIC configuration means telling to Linux os:
    Which network card to use
    What IP address it should have
    How it connects to other networks
    Whether it should start automatically
    Without NIC configuration, the server cannot communicate.

 NIC config ptahs are :
 rhel/centos : /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
 debian/ubuntu : /etc/netplan/

 inside this paths you can find or create nic config files like :
    eth0
    ens33/etc/netplan/
    enp0s3
    eno1

    Why NIC Configuration is Important
    Server must be reachable (SSH, apps, DB)
    IP must stay same after reboot
    Required for on-premise and cloud servers

How Linux Admin Configures NIC (assigne ip to server)
1.Identify NIC:

    ip link
    or
    ls /sys/class/net/

you can see nic file names  as :    
    lo
    ens33
    ifcfg-ens33

2. Decide IP Type
    Linux admin decides:
    DHCP → IP automatically
    Static → Fixed IP (servers)

3. NIC Configuration in RHEL / CentOS 
    
    vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens33

    and any one static or DHCP type of configuratins in the file and save and quite then restart the networkmanager  service.


        Static IP Example :
        --
        TYPE=Ethernet
        BOOTPROTO=static
        DEVICE=ens33
        ONBOOT=yes
        IPADDR=192.168.1.10
        NETMASK=255.255.255.0
        GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
        DNS1=8.8.8.8


        DHCP Example :
        

        BOOTPROTO=dhcp
        ONBOOT=yes

4. NIC Configuration in Ubuntu

    vi /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml

    static:
    

    network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
        ens33:
        dhcp4: no
        addresses:
            - 192.168.1.10/24
        gateway4: 192.168.1.1
        nameservers:
            addresses: [8.8.8.8]


    save & quite form /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml

    then netplan apply

5. Bring NIC UP in all type of os 

    nmcli device connect ens33
    or 
    systemctl restart NetworkManager

Verify Connectivity:
    ip addr
    ip route
    ping 8.8.8.8
    ping google.com





Field-by-Field  in configuratin file 


Static IP Configuration Fields (RHEL / CentOS)

### Example File
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens33


### Example Content
TYPE=Ethernet
BOOTPROTO=static
DEVICE=ens33
NAME=ens33
ONBOOT=yes
IPADDR=192.168.1.10
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
DNS1=8.8.8.8




### 1️⃣ TYPE=Ethernet

What it means:

 Type of network connection

Why used:

 Tells Linux this is a wired network card

👉 Usually always Ethernet



### 2️⃣ BOOTPROTO=static

What it means:

 How the IP address is assigned

Values:

 static → manual IP (server use)
 dhcp → automatic IP

Why used:

 Servers must keep the same IP always



### 3️⃣ DEVICE=ens33

What it means:

 Actual NIC name detected by Linux

Why used:

 Linux applies this config to this NIC only

👉 Must match output of:

bash
ip link




### 4️⃣ NAME=ens33

What it means:

 Human-readable name of the interface

Why used:

 Used by NetworkManager for identification

👉 Usually same as DEVICE



### 5️⃣ ONBOOT=yes

What it means:

 Bring NIC up automatically during boot

Why used:

 Without this, network will not start after reboot

If set to no:

 Admin must enable NIC manually



### 6️⃣ IPADDR=192.168.1.10

What it means:

 Static IP address of the server

Why used:

 Server needs a fixed identity on the network

👉 Example: Web server, DB server



### 7️⃣ NETMASK=255.255.255.0

What it means:

 Defines the network size

Layman meaning:

 Tells which devices are in the same network

👉 /24 network



### 8️⃣ GATEWAY=192.168.1.1

What it means:

 Router IP

Why used:

 Needed to reach:

   Internet
   Other networks

👉 Without gateway → no internet



### 9️⃣ DNS1=8.8.8.8

What it means:

 DNS server address

Why used:

 Converts domain names to IP addresses

Example:

text
google.com → 142.250.x.x


👉 Without DNS → only IP ping works



##  What Happens After Configuration

1. System boots
2. NIC detected
3. This file is read
4. IP, gateway, DNS applied
5. Network becomes active

##  What is Dynamic IP?

Dynamic IP is an IP address that is automatically assigned to a system by a DHCP server.

### Layman example:

 When you connect your mobile to Wi-Fi, it automatically gets an IP.
 You don’t manually enter any IP details.
 Next day, you may get a different IP.

👉 That is dynamic IP.

##  How Dynamic IP Works (Simple Flow)
1. System connects to network
2. Sends request: “I need an IP”
3. DHCP server assigns an available IP
4. IP is valid for some time (lease)
5. IP may change later

##  Where Dynamic IP is Used
 Home computers
 Laptops
 Mobile phones
 Temporary systems
 Test environments


##  What is Static IP?
Static IP is an IP address that is manually assigned and never changes.

### Layman example:
 Your house address never changes
 Courier always reaches you

👉 That is static IP.


##  Where Static IP is Used
 Web servers
 Database servers
 Mail servers
 Production systems
 Cloud VMs (mostly)

##  Difference Between Static and Dynamic IP

| Feature          | Static IP        | Dynamic IP       |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| IP assignment    | Manual           | Automatic (DHCP) |
| IP change        | Never            | Can change       |
| Configuration    | Admin configured | No manual config |
| Stability        | Very stable      | Not stable       |
| Use case         | Servers          | Clients          |
| Maintenance      | Admin effort     | Low effort       |
| Security control | Easy             | Less control     |



##  Linux Example

### Dynamic IP (DHCP)
BOOTPROTO=dhcp

### Static IP
BOOTPROTO=static
IPADDR=192.168.1.10

note:
Static = Server (fixed)
Dynamic = Device (auto)

##  One-Line Interview Answer

> Static NIC configuration fields define how a Linux server gets a fixed IP, gateway, and DNS so that the network is available automatically after reboot.

> Dynamic IP is an IP address automatically assigned by a DHCP server and may change over time, whereas static IP is manually configured and remains fixed.
