 Firewall

 1️⃣ Layman Meaning

 Think of a firewall as a security guard for your network.
 It decides who can enter, who is blocked, and what is allowed.

Simple Examples of Firewall Monitoring:

 Which websites are opened by users
 How long apps like Facebook or WhatsApp are used
 Which applications are accessed
 What data/files are sent or received
 Incoming and outgoing traffic

---

 2️⃣ IT / Technical Meaning

 Controls network traffic using rules
 Protects servers and networks from hackers and unauthorized access
 Can operate at different layers:

   Network Layer → IP/port-based rules
   Application Layer → Deep packet inspection
 Implements stateful (tracks connections) or stateless filtering

---

 3️⃣ Practical Examples in IT

 Block all incoming traffic except SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443)
 Restrict access to internal DB servers to only certain app servers
 Monitor and log traffic for security audits
 Control outbound traffic (prevent malware or data leaks)

 Firewall inspects traffic before it reaches internal servers.



Firewall = Security guard → controls, monitors, and protects network traffic.
