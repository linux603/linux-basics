 Azure Network Architecture 



 1️⃣ Virtual Network (VNet)

 Azure equivalent of VPC
 Private isolated network
 Contains subnets, route tables, NSGs
 Define IP range (CIDR), e.g., `10.1.0.0/16`



 2️⃣ Subnets

 Smaller networks inside VNet
 Public Subnet → VMs reachable from Internet (Web / Bastion)
 Private Subnet → Internal servers (App / DB)



 3️⃣ Internet Gateway (Azure calls it Public IP / Default Route)

 Needed for Internet access for public subnet



 4️⃣ NAT Gateway

 Allows private subnet VMs to access Internet outbound only
 Needed for patching and updates



 5️⃣ Route Tables

 Direct traffic within VNet or to Internet
 Associate with subnets

```text
Public Subnet → 0.0.0.0/0 → Internet
Private Subnet → 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway
```



 6️⃣ Network Security Groups (NSG)

 VM/subnet-level firewall
 Stateful
 Allows required ports only (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS)



 7️⃣ Azure Firewall / NACL

 Subnet-level stateless firewall
 Optional extra layer



 8️⃣ Load Balancer

 Distributes traffic across VMs
 Types:

   Azure LB (Layer 4)
   Application Gateway (Layer 7)



 9️⃣ VPN / VNet Peering

 VNet Peering → Connects VNets privately within Azure
 Site-to-Site VPN → Connect on-prem network to Azure
 Linux admin ensures routing, connectivity, and firewall rules



 10️⃣ DNS

 Azure DNS or custom DNS server
 Converts domain → IP
 Debugged using `dig`, `nslookup` in Linux



 11️⃣ Linux Admin Role

 Validate VNet, Subnet, NSG, and route tables
 Test connectivity using Linux tools
 Ensure private subnet can access Internet via NAT
 Troubleshoot VPN / Peering / DNS issues
