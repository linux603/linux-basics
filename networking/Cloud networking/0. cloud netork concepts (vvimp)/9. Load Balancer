 Load Balancer


 🔹 What is a Load Balancer 

A Load Balancer is a cloud component that distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers (VMs).

Instead of sending all users to one server, traffic is shared.



 🔹 Why Load Balancer is Needed

 1️⃣ High Availability

 If one server fails, traffic is sent to healthy servers
 Application remains available

 2️⃣ Scalability

 More users → add more servers
 Load balancer automatically spreads traffic



 🔹 How It Works (Simple Flow)


User
 ↓
Load Balancer (Public IP / DNS)
 ↓
VM1   VM2   VM3


Users never access servers directly.



 🔹 Common Types)

 Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) – fast, simple
 Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) – smart routing (URL, headers)



 🔹 Linux Admin Role 

 1️⃣ Configure web/application servers

 Ensure web service is running (nginx/apache)
 App must listen on correct port (80/443/8080)
 Firewall must allow traffic from Load Balancer



 2️⃣ Health Check Troubleshooting

Load balancer checks server health using:

 HTTP response
 TCP connection
 Custom URL

If server is unhealthy, traffic is stopped.

Linux admin checks:

systemctl status nginx
curl http://localhost/health
ss -tulnp




 🔹 Common Problem Scenario

 Website down even though server is running

Check:

 Health check URL correct?
 App responding with HTTP 200?
 Security Group allows traffic from LB?
 OS firewall allows LB traffic?



 🔹 Real-Life Example

 3 web servers behind load balancer
 One server crashes
 Users don’t notice any downtime

Load Balancer – Linux Admin Role



 🔹 What Linux Admin is NOT doing

        ❌ Creating load balancer type (ALB/NLB)
        ❌ Designing cloud architecture
        ❌ Managing DNS routing

👉 These are usually cloud / DevOps tasks



 🔹 What Linux Admin ACTUALLY DOES


 1️⃣ Prepare Backend Linux Servers

Linux admin ensures:

 OS is up and reachable
 Correct packages installed
 Service is running

 2️⃣ Configure Application Ports

 App listens on correct port (80 / 443 / 8080)

ss -tulnp

 App binds to 0.0.0.0, not localhost
  ❌ `127.0.0.1`
  ✅ `0.0.0.0`

 3️⃣ Configure Health Check Endpoint

Load balancer checks health using:

 `/`
 `/health`
 `/status`

Linux admin ensures:

curl http://localhost/health

returns 200 OK



 4️⃣ Firewall Configuration (Critical)

 Cloud Firewall (SG / NSG)

 Allow traffic from Load Balancer
 Open required ports

 OS Firewall

bash
firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload




 5️⃣ Troubleshoot “Unhealthy Instance”

When LB marks server unhealthy, Linux admin checks:

1️⃣ Is service running?

systemctl status nginx


2️⃣ Is app responding?

curl localhost


3️⃣ Is port open?

ss -tulnp


4️⃣ OS firewall blocking?

firewall-cmd --list-all


 6️⃣ Logs & Monitoring

bash
/var/log/nginx/access.log
/var/log/nginx/error.log
journalctl -u nginx

 7️⃣ SSL / TLS Support (Optional)

Linux admin:

 Installs certificates (if terminated on server)
 Fixes permission issues
 Validates HTTPS


 🔹 Real-Life Scenario

❌ Website down
LB shows 2/3 servers unhealthy

Linux admin finds:

 Service stopped on 1 server
 Health check URL wrong on another

Fix → site works again ✔️



 🔹 One-Line Interview Answer

> As a Linux admin, I configure backend servers, ensure applications are running and reachable, open required ports, and troubleshoot health check failures for load balancers.




Load Balancer manages traffic
Linux Admin keeps servers healthy
