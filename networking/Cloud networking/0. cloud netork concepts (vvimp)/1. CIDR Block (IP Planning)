 CIDR Block (IP Planning)

 ---> What is a CIDR Block 

A CIDR block defines the range of IP addresses that your cloud network (VPC/VNet) can use.

 In simple words:
CIDR decides how many servers you can have and what IPs they get.



  ---> Example Explained 

 Example CIDR:
10.0.0.0/16


 What this means:

 `10.0.0.0` → Network starting IP
 `/16` → Size of the network

 This CIDR gives:

 IP range from `10.0.0.0` to `10.0.255.255`
 About 65,000 private IP addresses



  ---> Why CIDR is Needed

 1️⃣ Prevent IP conflicts

 Every server must have a unique IP
 CIDR ensures IPs don’t overlap

 Without CIDR:

 Two servers may get same IP
 Network breaks



 2️⃣ Proper scaling

 Small CIDR → limited servers
 Large CIDR → future expansion

 Example:

 `/24` → ~256 IPs (small setup)
 `/16` → ~65,000 IPs (enterprise setup)



  Common CIDR Sizes (Easy to Teach)

| CIDR | IP Count | Usage            |
| /24  | ~256     | Small lab        |
| /20  | ~4096    | Medium setup     |
| /16  | ~65K     | Large production |



  ----> Linux Admin Role

 1️⃣ Ensure VM IP is inside CIDR

Linux admin checks:
ip addr

Example:
10.0.1.15


 Must belong to :
10.0.0.0/16

If not → server won’t communicate.



 2️⃣ Debug “IP not reachable” issues

Common issue:

 VM has IP `192.168.1.10`
 VPC CIDR is `10.0.0.0/16`

 Wrong network → no connectivity

Linux admin identifies:

 IP mismatch
 Wrong network placement

  ---> Real-Life 

Company plans:
 20 servers today
 200 servers in future

They choose:
10.0.0.0/16

 Enough IPs now and later
 No need to redesign network

> A CIDR block defines the IP address range for a cloud network and helps in IP planning, avoiding conflicts, and enabling scalable network design.



CIDR = IP range + network size
