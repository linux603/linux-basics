 Subnet (Network Segmentation)


  ---> What is a Subnet (Very Simple)

A subnet is a smaller network created inside a VPC.

 If VPC is a big land,
 Subnets are rooms inside that land.

You divide one large network into smaller parts to organize and secure resources.



  ---> Why Subnets are Needed

 1️⃣ Security separation

 Not all servers should be exposed to the internet
 Some must stay private

 2️⃣ Traffic control

 Decide which servers can:

   Talk to internet
   Talk only internally

 3️⃣ Better organization

 Separate:

   Web servers
   App servers
   Database servers
  Types of Subnets (Very Important)



1. Public Subnet

What it is
Subnet that has a route to the internet

Used for
 Web servers
 Bastion servers
 Load balancers

Example IP
10.0.1.0/24

Result
 Server is reachable from internet (if firewall allows)


2. Private Subnet

What it is
 Subnet with no direct internet access

Used for
 Database servers
 Internal application servers

Example IP
10.0.2.0/24

Result

 Server is internal only
 Cannot be accessed directly from internet



Important Clarification:

 Subnet itself is not public or private
 Route table makes it public or private

 Route to Internet Gateway → Public
 No route to Internet Gateway → Private



  ---> Linux Admin Role

 1️⃣ Know where the server is placed

Linux admin must know:

 Which subnet the server is in

Why?

 To understand reachability



 2️⃣ Public Subnet = Reachable

If server is in:

 Public subnet
 Has public IP
 Firewall allows access

 Linux admin can SSH directly.



 3️⃣ Private Subnet = Internal Only

If server is in:

 Private subnet
 No public IP

 Linux admin must:

 Use bastion host
 Use VPN
 Use internal jump server



  ---> Real-Life:

Company setup:
 Public subnet → Web server
 Private subnet → Database server

Users access:
Internet → Web Server → Database


Database is never exposed to internet → secure



  One-Line Interview Answer   *********imp

> A subnet is a smaller network inside a VPC used to segment resources for security and traffic control, such as separating public and private servers.



VPC = Big network
Subnet = Smaller secure sections
