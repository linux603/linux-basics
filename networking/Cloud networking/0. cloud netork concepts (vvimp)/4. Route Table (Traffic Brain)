 Route Table (Traffic Brain)



 ---> What is a Route Tablel
A Route Table is a set of rules that tells network traffic where to go.

 Think of it as a map for your cloud network.
 Every packet leaving a server asks:
  “Where should I go next?”
  The route table answers this.

  --->Why Route Table is Needed

 1️⃣ Without a route → traffic stops

 Even if IGW is attached, without a route → server cannot reach the internet
 Internal traffic between subnets also needs routing

 2️⃣ Control traffic paths
 Decide which subnet can reach which network
 Direct traffic to IGW, NAT, peering, VPN, or local subnet

Example 
0.0.0.0/0 → IGW

 `0.0.0.0/0` → all IPs (anywhere on internet)
 `→ IGW` → send this traffic to Internet Gateway

  Linux Admin Role (Practical)

 1️⃣ Debug internet access issues

 If server cannot reach internet:

ip route

 Check default route (0.0.0.0/0)
 Check route points to correct gateway (IGW/NAT)

 2️⃣ Verify internal connectivity

 Subnet-to-subnet traffic requires correct routes
 Check traffic goes to local route



  ---> Important Notes :

 Each subnet must be associated with a route table
 Subnet inherits rules from the associated route table
 You can have multiple route tables for different subnets



  ---> Real-Life 

Company setup:
 VPC CIDR: `10.0.0.0/16`
 Public subnet: `10.0.1.0/24` → route `0.0.0.0/0 → IGW`
 Private subnet: `10.0.2.0/24` → route `0.0.0.0/0 → NAT`

Result:
 Public servers → direct internet access
 Private servers → access internet through NAT only



  One-Line Interview Answer ********imp

> A route table is a set of rules in a VPC that directs network traffic, ensuring packets reach the correct destination such as IGW, NAT, or local subnet.




Route Table = Traffic Brain → “Where should packets go?
