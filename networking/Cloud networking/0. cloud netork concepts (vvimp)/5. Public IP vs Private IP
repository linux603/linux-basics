 Public IP vs Private IP


 🔹 Private IP (Internal Communication)

What it is:

 IP address inside the cloud network
 Used only for internal communication between servers

Key Points:

 Not accessible from the internet
 Always stays within VPC/subnet
 Examples: `10.0.0.10`, `192.168.1.5`

Use Case:
 App server → Database server communication
 Internal APIs

Linux Admin Role:
 Configure NIC with private IP
 Ensure apps and services communicate using private IPs
 Debug connectivity inside VPC/subnets


 🔹 Public IP (Internet Access)

What it is:

 IP address that is reachable from the internet
 Assigned to a server when it needs external access

Key Points:

 Allows SSH, HTTP, HTTPS from outside
 Usually mapped to a private IP (NAT) in cloud

Use Case:

 Web servers
 Bastion hosts
 Jump servers

Linux Admin Role:

 SSH into VM using public IP
 Ensure firewall/security groups allow access
 Map public IP → private IP for services

| Feature  | Private IP             | Public IP                   |
| Scope    | Internal               | Internet                    |
| Security | Safe inside VPC        | Exposed, needs firewall     |
| Use      | Internal communication | External access (SSH, HTTP) |
| Examples | 10.0.0.5               | 54.123.45.67                |



 🔹 Real-Life

 Web server in public subnet:

   Private IP: `10.0.1.10`
   Public IP: `52.11.22.33`
 Database server in private subnet:

   Private IP: `10.0.2.20`
   No public IP → cannot be accessed from internet

Result:

 Web server accessible from internet via public IP
 Database communicates with web server via private IP only



 🔹 One-Line Interview Answer  *******imp

> Private IP is for internal communication within a VPC, whereas Public IP allows a server to be accessed from the internet.



Private IP = Inside VPC
Public IP = Outside world access
