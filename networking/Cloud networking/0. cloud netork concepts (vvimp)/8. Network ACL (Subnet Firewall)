 Network ACL (Subnet Firewall)


 🔹 What is a Network ACL 

A Network ACL (NACL) is a cloud-level firewall that works at the subnet level.

👉 It controls which traffic is allowed in and out of a subnet
👉 It is stateless 


 🔹 Where it Works

Internet
   ↓
Network ACL (Subnet level)
   ↓
Security Group (VM level)
   ↓
Linux OS Firewall
   ↓
Application




 🔹 What “Stateless” Means (Important)

Stateless = no memory

 Inbound and outbound rules are separate
 If you allow inbound traffic → you must also allow outbound reply traffic

Example:

 Allow inbound TCP 80
 Must allow outbound ephemeral ports (1024–65535)

Otherwise:
 Website will not work



 🔹 Why NACL Is Needed

 1️⃣ Extra protection layer

 Acts as first security gate
 Blocks unwanted traffic before it reaches VMs

 2️⃣ Enterprise-level control

 Useful for compliance-heavy environments
 Central control for entire subnet



 🔹 Key Differences 

| Feature          | NACL             | Security Group / NSG        |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| Level            | Subnet           | VM / NIC                    |
| Stateful         | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes                     |
| Rules            | Allow + Deny     |  Allow only                 |
| Inbound/Outbound | Separate rules   | Return traffic auto-allowed |
| Default behavior | Cloud dependent  | Deny all (implicit)         |




 🔹 Linux Admin Role 

 Rarely configured directly by Linux admins
 Very useful during enterprise troubleshooting

If traffic is blocked:
 SG is open
 OS firewall is open
 App is running

👉 Then check NACL
 🔹 Real-Life Example

Company blocks:
 All traffic from suspicious IP ranges
 Entire subnet protected at once

Instead of:
 Configuring each VM individually



 🔹 One-Line Interview  *********imp 

> A Network ACL is a stateless, subnet-level firewall that provides an additional security layer by controlling inbound and outbound traffic for an entire subnet.




NACL = Subnet gate (stateless)
SG = VM gate (stateful)
