 AWS Network Architecture (Simplified)



 1️⃣ VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

 Private isolated network in AWS
 Contains subnets, route tables, gateways
 You define CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)



 2️⃣ Subnets

 Smaller networks inside VPC
 Public Subnet → Servers accessible from Internet
 Private Subnet → Internal servers (DB, App)

Example:

```
Public: 10.0.1.0/24
Private: 10.0.2.0/24
```



 3️⃣ Internet Gateway (IGW)

 Connects VPC → Internet
 Needed for public servers (web servers, bastion hosts)



 4️⃣ NAT Gateway

 Allows private subnet servers to access Internet outbound only
 Common for OS patching and package updates



 5️⃣ Route Tables

 Decide where traffic goes
 Public subnet route table:

```
0.0.0.0/0 → IGW
```

 Private subnet route table:

```
0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway
```



 6️⃣ Security Groups (SG)

 VM-level firewall
 Stateful
 Allow only required ports (22, 80, 443)



 7️⃣ Network ACL (NACL)

 Subnet-level firewall
 Stateless
 Optional extra security layer



 8️⃣ Load Balancer

 Distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances
 Types:

   ALB (Application Load Balancer) – Layer 7
   NLB (Network Load Balancer) – Layer 4
 Works with public/private subnets



 9️⃣ VPN / VPC Peering

 Private connectivity between VPCs or on-prem network
 VPN → Encrypted tunnel over Internet
 VPC Peering → Direct private connection (same cloud)



 10️⃣ DNS (Route 53)

 Converts domain → IP
 Manages internal & external DNS
 Used by Linux admins to debug DNS issues



 11️⃣ Flow S

```



 12️⃣ Linux Admin Role in AWS Network

 Check VPC, Subnet, and IP allocation
 Validate Security Groups and NACL
 Test connectivity using `ping`, `traceroute`
 Ensure servers in private subnet can access Internet (via NAT) for patching
 Debug VPN / Peering / DNS issues
