 Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) – Roles & Responsibilities

 1. Reliability & Availability Engineering

 Ensure high availability, reliability, and performance of production systems
 Define and manage SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs
 Design systems to tolerate failure and reduce downtime
 Perform capacity planning and reliability forecasting



 2. Automation & Elimination of Toil
 Automate repetitive operational tasks using:

   Ansible
   Shell/Python
   CI/CD pipelines
 Reduce manual intervention and operational overhead
 Implement self-healing and auto-remediation mechanisms



 3. Production Operations & Incident Management

 Own production stability and on-call rotations
 Lead incident response during outages
 Perform blameless postmortems
 Identify systemic issues and prevent recurrence



 4. Monitoring, Observability & Alerting

 Design and maintain observability stacks:

   Metrics, logs, traces
 Define meaningful alerts based on SLOs (not noise)
 Improve signal-to-noise ratio in monitoring
 Continuously refine dashboards and alerts



 5. Infrastructure & Platform Reliability

 Collaborate with infrastructure teams on:

   Resilient architecture
   Scaling strategies
   Failover mechanisms
 Ensure infrastructure changes do not violate reliability targets
 Validate disaster recovery and failover readiness



 6. CI/CD & Release Engineering

 Improve deployment reliability and safety
 Implement:

   Progressive delivery
   Rollbacks
   Canary and blue-green deployments
 Enforce release quality gates and automation



 7. Performance & Capacity Management

 Analyze system performance under load
 Identify bottlenecks and resource saturation
 Plan capacity for growth and peak usage
 Optimize cost without compromising reliability



 8. Security & Risk Management (Reliability View)

 Partner with security teams to:

   Patch vulnerabilities safely
   Reduce blast radius
 Implement safe defaults and least-risk configurations
 Ensure secure systems remain highly available



 9. Platform Engineering & Enablement

 Build internal platforms and tooling for developers
 Define operational standards and best practices
 Enable application teams to deploy and operate safely
 Provide reliability guidance during system design



 10. Continuous Improvement & Engineering Culture

 Track reliability trends and error budgets
 Balance feature velocity with system stability
 Advocate engineering excellence and resilience
 Drive reliability-focused engineering decisions
