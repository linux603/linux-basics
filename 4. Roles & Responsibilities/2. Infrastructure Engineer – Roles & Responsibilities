 1. Cloud Infrastructure Design & Provisioning

 Design and provision cloud infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and GCP
 Create and manage:

   VPC / VNet / VPC networks
   Subnets, route tables, gateways
   Load balancers and traffic routing
 Select appropriate compute types, scaling strategies, and regions
 Ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery



 2. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

 Develop, maintain, and version Terraform modules
 Manage Terraform state (remote backends, locking)
 Implement reusable, standardized infrastructure patterns
 Review and approve infrastructure changes via Git workflows
 Handle infrastructure lifecycle: create, update, destroy



 3. CI/CD for Infrastructure (Harness / GitHub)

 Build and manage infrastructure pipelines in Harness
 Integrate Terraform with CI/CD workflows
 Implement:

   Plan → approval → apply stages
   Environment-based deployments
 Enforce code quality, security, and policy checks
 Support GitOps practices



 4. Cloud Networking & Connectivity

 Design and manage:

   Network segmentation and isolation
   Hybrid connectivity (VPN, Direct Connect, ExpressRoute)
 Configure DNS, private endpoints, and routing policies
 Troubleshoot network latency, connectivity, and routing issues
 Implement ingress/egress controls



 5. Security & Identity Management (Cloud Layer)

 Implement IAM, roles, policies, and managed identities
 Enforce least-privilege access controls
 Manage cloud security constructs:

   Security Groups / NSGs
   Firewall rules
 Integrate with enterprise security and compliance tools
 Support audits and compliance requirements



 6. Compute, Storage & Scalability

 Provision and manage:

   Virtual machines and instance groups
   Auto-scaling configurations
   Block and object storage services
 Plan capacity and performance at infrastructure level
 Optimize infrastructure cost and resource utilization



 7. Image & Platform Enablement

 Maintain and publish base OS images (cloud images)
 Coordinate image pipelines with OS/platform teams
 Define bootstrapping mechanisms (cloud-init, metadata)
 Enable standard tagging and resource governance



 8. Monitoring, Reliability & Incident Response

 Implement cloud-level monitoring and alerting
 Ensure infrastructure uptime and SLA adherence
 Lead response to infrastructure outages
 Perform root cause analysis (RCA) for infra incidents
 Improve resilience through automation and design changes



 9. Governance, Standards & Documentation

 Define infrastructure standards and best practices
 Enforce naming conventions, tagging, and policies
 Maintain architectural diagrams and documentation
 Participate in design reviews and change approvals



 10. Cross-Team Collaboration

 Work closely with:

   Linux / Platform teams
   Security teams
   Application & DevOps teams
 Support application onboarding to cloud platforms
 Provide infrastructure expertise during planning and releases
