 1. Linux admin (Core Responsibility)

You own the OS layer across thousands of servers.

 Responsibilities

 Provision/build, configure, and maintain RHEL / CentOS / suse / Oracle Linux / ubuntu systems
 OS hardening based on CIS / internal security baselines
 User, group, sudo, PAM, SSH hardening
 Kernel tuning, sysctl, ulimit, hugepages
 Package lifecycle management (yum/dnf, repo management / patching)
 System performance monitoring (CPU, memory, disk, IO, load)
 Disk management (LVM, filesystems, mount lifecycle)
 handling NTP, DNS, NFS, FTP 


 2. Configuration Management – Ansible Tower 

You are responsible for desired state enforcement.

 Responsibilities

 Develop and maintain Ansible roles & playbooks
 Use Ansible Tower for:
   Job templates
   Inventories (dynamic cloud inventories)
   Credential management
   RBAC and approval workflows
 Enforce configuration drift remediation
 Rolling updates with zero downtime
 OS patching automation (monthly / emergency)

 Example Work
 Baseline OS role
 Hardening role
 Monitoring/logging agent deployment
 App prerequisite roles
 Compliance enforcement



 3. Cloud Infrastructure (AWS / Azure / GCP)

You manage Linux in cloud, not just Linux itself.

 Responsibilities

 Understand cloud compute primitives:

   EC2 / VM / Compute Engine
   Images (AMI, Azure Image, GCP Image)

 Cloud networking basics:

   VPC / VNet
   Subnets, routing, security groups / NSGs
 Storage:

   EBS / Managed Disks / Persistent Disks
 Cloud-native monitoring & logging integrations
 Instance metadata, IAM roles, managed identities

You may not create infra manually, but you must operate it correctly.

 4. Infrastructure as Code – Terraform

You treat infrastructure like software.

 Responsibilities

 Review and contribute to Terraform modules
 Understand:
   Providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
   State management (remote backend)
   Variables, outputs, modules

 Validate Linux-related infra changes:
   Disk size changes
   Instance types
   OS image updates

 Coordinate Terraform + Ansible workflows



 5. CI/CD & Automation – Harness + GitHub

You work in GitOps / pipeline-driven operations.

 Responsibilities

 Maintain OS automation pipelines in Harness
 Trigger Ansible/Terraform jobs via pipelines

 Version control:
   Ansible code
   Terraform modules
   Shell scripts

 Participate in:
   PR reviews
   Branching strategies
   Code quality checks

 Support automated:
   Image builds
   Patch rollouts
   Security fixes



 6. Security, Compliance & Hardening

Security is built-in, not afterthought.

 Responsibilities

 OS hardening & security baseline enforcement
 Vulnerability remediation (CVE patching)
 Certificate management
 Integration with security tools (scanners, agents)
 SELinux configuration and troubleshooting
 Audit readiness (SOX, SOC, ISO)



 7. Monitoring, Logging & Incident Support

You ensure platform reliability.

 Responsibilities

 OS-level monitoring (CPU, disk, memory, inode)
 Log forwarding and retention
 On-call support for:

   OS crashes
   Disk full incidents
   Performance degradation
 Root cause analysis (RCA)
 Preventive automation



 8. Collaboration & Enablement

You act as a platform enabler.

 Responsibilities

 Support application teams with:

   OS prerequisites
   Performance tuning
   Troubleshooting
   
 Create documentation & runbooks
 Knowledge sharing & standardization
 Work with:

   Security teams
   Cloud teams
   DevOps teams
