# VSCO 

Nature of services: Mixed — primarily public-facing (B2C) with critical internal services.
VSCO is a consumer photo/editing platform, so the user-facing apps and media APIs are public internet-facing; backend tooling, analytics, and admin dashboards are internal.

Key public-facing components

* Mobile & Web Frontend APIs — handle user auth, profiles, feed, image upload/download, edits, filters.
* Media Processing & CDN — image transcoding, resizing, format conversion; cached on CDN for global delivery.
* Authentication & Session Services — OAuth/JWT issuing, refresh tokens.
* Search & Recommendations APIs — user content discovery (high read traffic).
* Payment/subscription gateway — if monetized (in-app purchases, subscriptions).

Key internal components

* Content moderation & admin dashboards — tools for trust & safety teams.
* Analytics pipelines — event collection, batch/stream processing (engagement metrics).
* Developer & CI/CD tooling — build systems, staging environments, feature-flagging.
* Internal microservices — ingestion pipelines, batch workers, ETL jobs.

Security & access patterns

* Public APIs protected via HTTPS, rate-limiting, WAF, token-based auth; CDNs offload static content.
* Internal services protected in private networks/VPCs, accessed via VPN/IDP-SAML SSO, and RBAC.
* Data privacy: user PII and media require encryption at rest and in transit; compliance with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR) depending on regions.

Operational considerations (what you’d manage)

* Scalability: autoscaling for upload/serve traffic; cache tuning and CDN rules to reduce origin load.
* Availability: multi-region deployments, active-active or active-passive for critical APIs, health checks, failover.
* Storage: object storage lifecycle policies, hot/cold tiers for old images, retention.
* Performance: CDN configuration, image optimization, latency budgets for page/app load.
* Monitoring & SLOs: API latency, error rate, media pipeline throughput, CDN cache hit ratio, storage usage.
* Incident types: CDN misconfig, origin overload, transcoder backlogs, authentication failures, data corruption.

Typical troubleshooting tasks

* SSH into app/media servers for logs; inspect queues, disk IO, CPU; check CDN edge error logs and origin latency; analyze application traces for slow requests; verify database/storage connectivity and performance.

Interview-ready short answer (VSCO)

> “For a VSCO-like platform most services are public-facing (user apps, media APIs, CDN) and I also manage internal services (moderation tools, analytics, CI). My focus is on low-latency media delivery, CDN/cache tuning, autoscaling for spikes, secure auth, and ensuring storage and processing pipelines are reliable.”

# SAP Ariba — Detailed explanation

Nature of services: Primarily B2B enterprise-facing, internally accessed by organizations but externally reachable — i.e., not public consumer apps but accessible by enterprise users and third-party systems (securely). Services are external-to-enterprise but restricted and authenticated.

Key public/external-facing components

* Procurement & Sourcing Portals — buyer and supplier web UIs (accessed by enterprise users over the internet).
* APIs for Integration — SOAP/REST endpoints for ERP integrations (SAP ECC/S4, Oracle), invoice/PO exchange.
* Supplier & Catalog Services — vendor onboarding flows, catalog publishing.
* E-invoicing & Payment connectors — integrations with payment/ERP systems and banks.

Key internal components

* Data processing & reconciliation — matching POs, invoices, settlement logic.
* Workflow engines — approval flows, contract lifecycle management.
* Compliance & audit systems — logging, records retention, access audit trails.
* Integration adapters — queue workers, adapters for EDI, SAP connectors.
* Analytics & reporting — spend analysis, supplier performance dashboards.

Security & compliance

* Enterprise-grade security: strict IAM, SSO (SAML/OAuth), granular RBAC, encryption, network isolation, API throttling.
* Regulatory/compliance needs: financial/audit compliance, data residency, contractual SLAs, and possibly certifications (SOC2, ISO27001).
* Logging and non-repudiation for procurement/legal record-keeping.

Operational considerations (what you’d manage)

* Controlled external access: VPNs, IP allowlists, customer-specific network peering, or secure public endpoints with strong auth.
* High reliability for business processes: strong guarantees around message delivery, exactly-once/at-least-once semantics for financial operations.
* Data integrity & backup: immutable logs, transactional integrity between systems, careful DB migrations.
* Multi-tenant isolation: tenant data separation, quotas, and per-customer configs.
* Monitoring & SLOs: transaction success rate, integration latency (ERP sync), invoice/PO processing time, reconciliation drift.
* Incident types: failed integrations, message queue delays, reconciliation mismatches, auth/SSO failures, data mapping errors.

Typical troubleshooting tasks

* Investigate API logs and integration queues; check message broker health and retry queues; examine DB transactions and locks; trace cross-system flows (ERP → Ariba → Bank) for missing/duplicated documents; review audit trails and access logs.

Interview-ready short answer (SAP Ariba)

> “In an SAP Ariba-like environment services are enterprise-facing: external to the company but secured and used by buyers, suppliers, and ERP systems. I focus on secure API exposure, reliable message delivery, multi-tenant isolation, compliance, and ensuring transactional integrity between procurement and backend ERP systems.”

# PhonePe — Detailed explanation

Nature of services: Mixed but strongly public internet-facing (B2C) for payments plus B2B (merchant services) and B2A interactions (NPCI, government billers). Payment systems are public-facing and require real-time processing, high throughput, and stringent security.

Key public-facing components

* UPI/payment APIs & Mobile Backend — user-initiated payments, UPI collect/push flows, wallet operations.
* Authentication & KYC services — user onboarding, device binding, 2FA.
* Merchant-facing endpoints — QR payments, POS integrations, merchant dashboards.
* Notification & event systems — SMS, push notifications, payment confirmations.

Key internal components

* Risk & fraud engine — real-time scoring, rules engine, ML models.
* Settlement & reconciliation pipelines — clearing with banks/UPI rails, settlements to merchants.
* Ledger & financial accounting systems — custody, wallet balances, transaction state machines.
* Compliance & AML tooling — suspicious transaction detection, reporting.
* Batch processing systems — settlement, reconciliations, chargebacks.

Security & regulatory

* Strong authentication, end-to-end encryption, hardware/security modules for keys, PCI-DSS scope if card data, regulatory reporting, data retention and KYC/AML compliance. Integration with NPCI for UPI-specific rules and settlement.

Operational considerations (what you’d manage)

* Extremely low latency & high throughput: payment flows must be sub-second; scale horizontally with low tail latency.
* High availability & fault isolation: regional redundancy, circuit breakers, graceful degradation for non-critical features.
* Strict observability: detailed traces, per-transaction logs, real-time dashboards for payments per second, success/failure rates.
* Data integrity & consistency: ledger correctness, idempotency in payment processing.
* Security & audits: frequent pen tests, key rotation, secrets management, compliance audits.
* Monitoring & SLOs: transaction success rate, end-to-end payment latency, fraud detection latency, settlement accuracy.
* Incident types: upstream NPCI outages, settlement mismatches, fraud spikes, DB contention on ledger tables, certificate failures, latency-induced timeouts.

Typical troubleshooting tasks

* Trace a payment across services (auth → UPI gateway → bank → callback); inspect message brokers and retry queues; check risk engine decisions; verify ledger entries and reconciliation files; analyze network traces for timeouts; rotate/troubleshoot keys and certificates.

# Cross-cutting operational practices (applies for all three)

1. Access & Audit

   * Use centralized IAM (IdP), short-lived credentials, SSH bastion hosts, and audit logging.
2. Infrastructure as Code

   * Terraform + Packer + Ansible to enforce repeatable environment creation.
3. CI/CD

   * Pipeline for builds, tests, security scans, canary/blue-green deployments.
4. Observability

   * Metrics, logs, traces; alerting with ownership and escalation; SLO/SLI tracking.
5. Secrets Management

   * Vault or cloud KMS for DB/passwords/certs.
6. Backups & DR

   * Backups, recovery drills, RPO/RTO definitions, cross-region failover testing.
7. Compliance & Security

   * Regular patching, vulnerability scans, container/image scanning, network isolation.
8. On-call & Incident Management

   * Runbook run-throughs, postmortems, playbooks for common incidents.




skills required to mange this environments


Managing both types of environments means handling two different traffic layers:

---

#  1. What Are Internet-Facing Environments? (External)

These are systems that your customers, users, or external clients access from the public internet.

Examples:

* Mobile app backend APIs
* Payment API (PhonePe, GPay-like)
* Customer portals (VSCO, SAP Ariba login)
* Web applications
* Ordering systems
* Public API gateways

These systems are exposed through:

* Public DNS
* CDN
* Load balancers
* Public IP
* Firewalls + WAF

###  Your Responsibilities for External Services

As an SRE/DevOps/Linux Admin, you must:

### 1. Secure the entry point

* Set up SSL/TLS certificates
* Configure WAF rules (block bots, attacks)
* Rate limiting (avoid abuse)
* Enable DDOS protection

### 2. Route Internet Traffic Correctly

* Use public DNS (Cloudflare, Route53)
* Configure load balancers (ALB/NLB/Ingress)
* Use reverse proxy (Nginx/HAProxy)

### 3. Ensure High Availability

* Multi-zone servers
* Auto scaling (horizontal)
* Health checks
* Failover mechanisms

### 4. Monitor and Troubleshoot

You watch:

* Error rates
* Response time (p95/p99)
* Traffic spikes
* API failures
* Database slowdowns

You use tools:

* Prometheus
* Grafana
* ELK / Loki
* Jaeger (tracing)
* tcpdump/ss for network issues

---

# 🟩 2. What Are Internal Environments?

These services run inside your private company network, NOT exposed to the internet.

Examples:

* CI/CD systems
* Internal APIs
* Analytics pipelines
* Fraud detection (PhonePe)
* ERP integrations (SAP Ariba)
* Worker jobs, cron jobs
* Databases & message queues
* Internal admin dashboards

Accessible via:

* VPC private subnets
* VPN
* Internal DNS
* Zero-trust access

###  Your Responsibilities for Internal Services

### 1. Design Secure Private Networks

* VPC segmentation
* Private subnets
* Security groups / Firewalls
* Internal DNS (CoreDNS/Bind)

### 2. Maintain Service-to-Service Connectivity

Internal services talk to each other:

* API ➝ DB
* Microservice ➝ Message queue
* Worker ➝ Storage
* SAP system ➝ Ariba API

You ensure:

* DNS resolves
* Firewall ports open
* Latency low
* No packet drops

### 3. Keep Internal Apps Reliable

* Zero downtime deployments
* Scaling background workers
* Monitoring queue length
* Debugging internal API timeouts

### 4. Control Access

* Role-based access (RBAC)
* SSH key management
* IAM user permissions
* VPN/SAML authentication
