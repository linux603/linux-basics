Purpose: Copy files or directories.

Options:

 cp file1 file2 → copy a single file
 cp -r dir1 dir2 → copy directories recursively
 cp -u file /dest → copy only if source is newer

cp -r /home/docs /backup/docs


Use Case: Backup files, duplicate data, or move configuration files safely.

---

### 8. mv

Purpose: Move or rename files/directories.

Examples:

 mv file.txt /tmp/ → move a file
 mv oldname.txt newname.txt → rename a file
 mv -i file /dest → interactive prompt before overwrite

Use Case: Organize filesystem, rename files, or relocate directories.

---

### 9. touch

Purpose: Create empty files or update timestamps.

Examples:

 touch file.txt → create new empty file
 touch -c file.txt → do not create if it does not exist
 touch -t 202511291300 file.txt → set specific timestamp

Use Case: Create placeholder files, update modification times for scripts or logs.

---

### 10. file

Purpose: Identify file type.

Examples:

 file file.txt → ASCII text file
 file /bin/ls → ELF 64-bit executable

Use Case: Verify whether a file is text, binary, executable, or script before executing or editing.

---

### 11. stat

Purpose: Show detailed file info including size, permissions, inode, timestamps.

Examples:

 stat file.txt → show all info
 stat -c "%n %s %U %G" file.txt → custom output: name, size, user, group

Use Case: Audit files, check last access/modification times, verify ownership.

---

### 12. chmod

Purpose: Change file permissions.

Examples:

 chmod 755 script.sh → standard executable permissions
 chmod u+x file.txt → add execute permission for user
 chmod -R 700 /home/rohit → recursively set permissions

Use Case: Secure files, allow scripts to execute, manage access in multi-user environments.

---

### 13. chown

Purpose: Change file or directory owner/group.

Examples:

 chown rohit file.txt → change owner
 chown rohit:users file.txt → change owner and group
 chown -R rohit:users /home/rohit → recursive change

Use Case: Assign ownership for security and proper management of files.

---

### 14. ln

Purpose: Create links to files.

Examples:

 ln file1 file2 → hard link
 ln -s file1 file1_link → symbolic link
 ln -sf target linkname → force overwrite

Use Case: Create shortcuts or share files without duplicating data.

---

### 15. find

Purpose: Locate files or directories based on name, type, size, permissions, modification time, etc.

Examples:

 find /home -name ".log" → find files by name
 find /var/log -type d -name "log" → directories only
 find /tmp -size +50M → files larger than 50 MB
 find /var/log -mtime -7 → files modified in last 7 days
 find /tmp -name ".log" -exec rm {} \; → execute command on each match

Use Case: Automate cleanup, locate files for backup, or identify files by size/date for audits.

---

### 16. locate

Purpose: Quickly find files using a pre-built database.

Examples:

 locate file1.txt → find file
 sudo updatedb → update the search database

Use Case: Faster than find for large filesystems when the database is updated.

---

### 17. tree

Purpose: Show directory structure in a tree view.

Examples:

 tree /home → full directory tree
 tree -L 2 /home → limit depth to 2 levels
 tree -a /home → include hidden files

Use Case: Visualize directory hierarchies and subdirectories.

---

### 18. wc

Purpose: Count lines, words, or characters in a file.

Examples:

 wc file.txt → show lines, words, and characters
 wc -l file.txt → count lines
 wc -w file.txt → count words
 wc -c file.txt → count characters

Use Case: Script analytics, check file size in lines or words.

---

### 19. head / tail

Purpose: Preview the start or end of files.

Examples:

 head file.txt → first 10 lines
 head -n 20 file.txt → first 20 lines
 tail file.txt → last 10 lines
 tail -f /var/log/messages → live log monitoring

Use Case: Quickly debug logs, check configuration files, or monitor active logs.

---

### 20. cat / less / more

Purpose: Read file content.

Examples:

 cat file.txt → print entire file
 less file.txt → scroll interactively
 more file.txt → scroll page by page

---

### 21. tar / zip

Purpose: Archive and compress files or directories.

Examples:

 tar -cvf backup.tar /home/docs → create tar archive
 tar -xvf backup.tar → extract tar archive
 tar -czvf backup.tar.gz /home/docs → gzip compression
 zip archive.zip file1 file2 → create zip archive
 unzip archive.zip → extract zip

Use Case: Backup directories, compress data for transfer, or archive logs.

---

### 22. grep

Purpose: Search for patterns in files or command output.

Examples:

 grep "ERROR" /var/log/messages → search text
 grep -i "error" /var/log/messages → case-insensitive
 grep -r "Listen" /etc/httpd/ → recursive search
 grep -n "failed" /var/log/secure → show line numbers
 ps aux | grep nginx → filter process list

Use Case: Analyze logs, search configuration files, filter command outputs.

---

### 23. find (advanced use)

Purpose: Locate files/directories and perform actions on them.
