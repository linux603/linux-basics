Public DNS (Internet-wide)
=============================
Examples:

            www.google.com

            www.facebook.com

            www.amazon.com

            www.aadhaar.gov.in

👉 Managed globally
👉 Domains are registered publicly
👉 Governed by ICANN (not directly IANA in daily ops)

🔹 ICANN manages domain names
🔹 IANA manages IP ranges, root zone, protocol numbers

Private DNS (Company internal)
==============================
Examples:

        timesheet.ibm.com

        hrqueries.ibm.com

portal.ibm.com

👉 Only accessible inside company network
👉 Managed by Linux / Windows administrators
👉 Stored on internal DNS servers
