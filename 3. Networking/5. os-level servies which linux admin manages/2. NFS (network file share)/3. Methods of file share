There are 3 valid real-world ways to configure NFS:

1. DAS-based NFS server
2. NAS-backed Linux NFS server
3. NAS appliance acting directly as NFS server



 1. NFS Server Using DAS (Direct Attached Storage)

 Architecture :- Local Disk  →  NFS Server  →  Clients
---------------

 Storage disk is physically attached to the NFS server
 The same server handles:
                            Storage
                            NFS services
                            NFS shares are created from the server’s local filesystem

 Characteristics :
------------------
                Simple to configure
                Low cost
                Single point of failure
                Limited scalability

 Typical Use Cases :
 ------------------
                Development environments
                QA systems
                Small production workloads



 2. NFS Server Using NAS (Network Attached Storage)

 Architecture :- NAS Storage  →  Network  →  NFS Server / Clients
----------------

 Storage is external and independent of the NFS server
 NAS provides shared storage over the network
 Servers mount storage from NAS and re-share or directly access it via NFS

 Characteristics :-
----------------
                High availability
                Snapshots and replication
                Scalable and resilient
                Enterprise-grade solution

 Typical Use Cases :-
-----------------
                    Banking systems
                    E-commerce platforms
                    Mission-critical production systems


 3. NFS Server Using NAS Appliance (Storage-Led NFS)

 Architecture :- NAS Appliance (Storage + NFS Service)  →  Network  →  Clients
--------------

 The storage device itself runs the NFS service
 No separate Linux NFS server is required
 Filesystems are created and exported directly from the storage system
 NFS is handled by the storage controller OS

 Characteristics :-
----------------
                Highly available by design
                Built-in snapshots, replication, and failover
                Optimized for performance and scalability
                Minimal administrative overhead on servers

 Typical Use Cases :-
------------------
                Banking and financial systems
                Large-scale enterprise applications
                Business-critical production workloads
