What is a firewall?  **********imp

A firewall is a security mechanism that controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.


 What are the types of firewalls used in organizations? **********imp

1) Physical / Network Firewall

Dedicated hardware or virtual appliance (Palo Alto, FortiGate, Cisco, etc.)

Protects the entire organization network

Controls traffic between networks (Internet ↔ Data Center ↔ DMZ)

2) OS-level Firewall

Runs on the individual server or machine

Examples:

Linux → firewalld, iptables, nftables

Windows → Windows Defender Firewall

Controls traffic to and from that specific machine only


2) Which firewall comes under an OS administrator’s responsibility?

OS-level firewall

OS admins manage:

Open/close ports

Allow/block services

Zone configuration

note : Network teams usually manage physical firewalls

3) Cloud Firewall / NSG (NEW)

A virtual firewall provided by cloud platforms to control inbound and outbound traffic at:

VM level

Subnet level

Network interface level

| Cloud | Firewall Name                |
| ----- | ---------------------------- |
| AWS   | Security Groups / NACL       |
| Azure | NSG (Network Security Group) |
| GCP   | VPC Firewall Rules           |


Who manages Cloud Firewall / NSG?

Cloud / Infrastructure / DevOps team

Not OS admins (generally)


| Layer                | Scope              | Managed By     |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| Physical Firewall    | Entire data center | Network team   |
| Cloud Firewall / NSG | VPC / Subnet / VM  | Cloud / DevOps |
| OS Firewall          | Single server      | OS Admin       |





Is OS-level firewall disabled by default in organizations? **********imp

This is a common misconception

Reality (Production best practice):

Many organizations KEEP OS-level firewall enabled

Physical firewall ≠ replacement for OS firewall

OS firewall provides:

Defense in depth

Protection from lateral movement

Host-level security

However:

Some legacy or poorly managed environments disable it due to:

Lack of automation

Best practice is to use both physical and OS-level firewalls.”
