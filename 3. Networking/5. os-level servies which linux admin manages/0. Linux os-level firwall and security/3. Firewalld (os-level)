 firewalld --- in linux os 

 Windows Defender Firewall --- in  Windows os 



 Why OS Firewall is Required

Even inside the same network:

 One compromised server can attack another
 OS firewall blocks lateral movement

Cloud firewall cannot always protect:

 VM-to-VM traffic inside same subnet form Local attacks



 4. Linux OS Firewall – firewalld 

 What is firewalld?

 firewalld is the default firewall management service in modern Linux systems
(RHEL, CentOS, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, Fedora).


note:
 Zone-based firewall
 Dynamic (no reboot needed)
 Uses `firewall-cmd`

What does “dynamic” mean?

Firewall rules can be:

Added

Removed

Modified

Without restarting the firewall service

No network interruption

What does Zones mean:

| Zone     | Meaning               |
------------------------------------
| public   | Untrusted network     |
| internal | Internal network      |
| trusted  | All traffic allowed   |
| dmz      | Public-facing servers |

Each network interface belongs to a zone

 Difference Between Allowing a Service and Allowing a Port in firewalld

| Aspect          | Allow Service                              | Allow Port                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| What it uses    | Service name                               | Port number                |
| Example         | `ssh`, `http`, `nfs`                       | `22`, `80`, `2049`         |
| Ports handled   | Automatically opens all required ports     | Only one specific port     |
| Ease of use     | Easy                                       | Manual                     |
| Risk of mistake | Low                                        | Higher                     |
| Best for        | Standard services                          | Custom / non-standard apps |


 Allow Service → firewalld knows which ports the service needs
 Allow Port → admin must know and open the exact port


commands to allow & block servie/port on FW:

how to check which are the services are allowed through firewall?
	firewall-cmd --list-services
	firewall-cmd --list-ports


allow 2049
	firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=2049/tcp --permanent
	firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=2049/udp --permanent
	firewall-cmd --reload

remove rule from firewall
	firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-port=2049/udp --permanent
	firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-port=2049/tcp --permanent
	firewall-cmd --reload

allow nfs service in firewall
		firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=nfs --permanent 
		firewall-cmd --reload
	firewall-cmd --list-services

remove nfs service in firewall
		firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-service=nfs --permanent 
		firewall-cmd --reload
	firewall-cmd --list-services
