-> how to deny root login through ssh service?

	step 1 : change the ssh paramter that is "PermitRootLogin" to no
		vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	
		PermitRootLogin no

	Step 2 : restart the service
		systemctl restart sshd

note :
> in IT sectore, We don’t let people log in as root directly because root has full control of the system. If someone guesses the root password, they can do anything. 
  By logging in as a normal user and using sudo when needed, the system is safer, mistakes are less dangerous, and we know who did what.


-> How to disable normal users?
	
	step 1 : specify users in ssh configuration file  under DenyUsers list
			vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
				DenyUsers rk bindu pratap
	Step 2 : restart the ssh service
			systemctl restart sshd

-> how to deny groups?
		vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
			DenyGroups	group1 group2



-> How to change the ssh service port number?
	
	what is the default port number of ssh? 22
	going forward want use 2222 for ssh service?

step 1 : update new port number in configuration file
		vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
			Port 2222
Step 2 : update se linux policy. because right now se linux knows 22 port is for ssh service but now we are chainging to 2222
		semanage  port -a -t ssh_port_t  -p tcp 2222
step 3 : Restart the service
		systemctl restart sshd

	systemctl restart sshd



-> how to configuring password less authentication between 2 machines?

Passwordless authentication (usually using SSH keys) is used to log in without typing a password.

	machine 1 : 192.168.145.10
	machine 2 : 192.168.145.186

	186 machine want to connect with 10 as rk user without password

	rk has to share public key with 10 machine prasad user then password less is allowed


	step1 :  login to 186 machine as a rk user and generate keys
		
		then run command : ssh-keygen
		
							do enter
							do enter
							do enter

	step 2 : share pub key with remote machine
			
			ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub 192.168.145.10
			or 
			manuvally we can copy 

	
	now do ssh to 192.168.145.10, whithout asking password ssh will happens now.
