 Unique Feature of secure shell (ssh) :
====================================

 SSH provides security through data encryption.
 Unlike FTP (which sends data in plain binary), SSH encrypts all data, so only the intended recipient can decrypt it using the correct private key.


 Public / Private Keys :
========================
 Each user has a hidden `.ssh` directory in their home folder containing two keys:
                                                                            1. Public Key → encrypts data
                                                                            2. Private Key → decrypts data

Example Paths:
 Root user: `/root/.ssh`
 Regular user `rk`: `/home/rk/.ssh`

 Keys are used to authenticate and create a secure tunnel between machines.


note : fails if your account don’t have a valid private keys 
Generate a key pair using command : ssh-keygen


 SSH, SCP, and SFTP :
 ==================
 When two machines communicate using SSH, SCP, or SFTP:
  1. They perform a handshake to exchange keys.
  2. A secure encrypted tunnel is created.
  3. All data sent through this tunnel is encrypted and safe.

Protocol Uses:
==============
 SSH → secure remote shell (administration)
 SCP → secure copy (files/directories)
 SFTP → secure file transfer protocol


 Comparison: SSH vs FTP :
=======================
| Feature               | SSH / SCP / SFTP                | FTP                       |

| File transfer         | Files & directories (encrypted) | Files only (binary/plain) |
| Data security         | Encrypted                       | Not encrypted             |
| Remote administration | Yes                             | No                        |
| Protocol              | SSH                             | FTP (non-secure)          |

Note:
 HTTPS uses TLS/SSL (not SSH) for encryption.
 HTTP / FTP do not encrypt data by default.



 How to Connect to a Remote Machine Using SSH ?
 ==============================================

Connect as current user form client to server:
                                                ssh remotemachineip
Connect with specific user to server form clent:
                                                ssh username@remotemachineip
                                                ssh -l username remotemachineip
Opens a secure shell session on the remote machine.

note :
There are three main ways to authenticate via SSH, depending on how the server and client are configured:

 1. Password-Based Authentication
 =================================
 Description: The user provides a username and password to log in.
 How it works:
  1. Client connects to the SSH server.
  2. Server prompts for password.
  3. If correct, a secure session is established.
 Pros: Simple, no key management required.
 Cons: Less secure; vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

Example:
        ssh username@192.168.1.10
        username@192.168.1.10's password:

 2. Public/Private Key Authentication (Key-Based or Passwordless Authentication)
 ================================================
 Description: Uses a key pair: public key on the server, private key on the client.
 How it works:
  1. Client presents the private key.
  2. Server checks if the corresponding public key exists in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
  3. If matched, login is granted.
 Pros: More secure, can disable passwords, good for automation (scripts, CI/CD).
 Cons: Key must be generated and managed properly.

Example:
ssh-keygen                          Generate key pair
ssh-copy-id username@192.168.1.10   Copy public key to server
ssh username@192.168.1.10           Login using key

 3. Host-Based Authentication
 Description: The client machine itself is trusted; any user from the client host can log in without a password.
 How it works:
Server trusts the client’s host key and allows connections from it.
 Pros: Useful in trusted internal networks.
 Cons: Rarely used; less secure than key-based auth.



| Authentication Method | How It Works                                | Security | Use Case                       |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Password-based        | Enter username & password                   | Low      | Small setups, temporary access |
| Public/Private Key    | Private key on client, public key on server | High     | Production servers, automation |
| Host-based            | Client host is trusted                      | Medium   | Internal trusted network       |




 How to Copy Files / Directories Using SCP
 =========================================

 Copy a directory securely
scp -r /local/dir rk@192.168.145.10:/home/rk/

 Copy a single file
scp /home/rk/file.txt rk@192.168.145.10:/home/rk/

 `-r` → recursive copy for directories
 Uses SSH encryption for security.



 Root Privileges Requirement
=============================
 Only root or users with `sudo` can perform administrative tasks.
 Examples:
   `useradd` → create new user → requires root
   `lvcreate` → create LVM volume → requires root

Scenario:
 10 Linux admins need root credentials to manage all servers.
 Normal users cannot perform administration tasks.
