DNS Components — With IT Company Example
=========================================
Let’s assume an IT company called TechCorp :
                                                Domain:
                                                techcorp.com
                                                Website:
                                                www.techcorp.com

 1. DNS Resolver :
=================
 What it is : A DNS Resolver is the server that employees’ systems contact first to resolve domain names.

 Role :
 Receives DNS queries from users
 Finds the IP by querying other DNS servers
 Returns the final answer

 IT Company Example :
                    At TechCorp:
                    Employees’ laptops use: 10.10.0.10, This ip is the internal DNS resolver
                    Employee types broweser: www.techcorp.com
                    The laptop asks to 10.10.0.10 (resolver):
                    “What is the IP of [www.techcorp.com?”](http://www.techcorp.com?”)
                    The resolver now does the lookup work.


 2. Root DNS Server :
 ==================
 What it is: The top-most DNS servers in the global DNS system.

 Role :
 Knows where TLD servers are, but does NOT know website IPs

 IT Company Example Resolver asks Root server:
                                                “Who manages `.com`?”
                                                 Root replies: “These servers manage `.com` domains”

 Root is like the Internet entry point.


 3. TLD (Top-Level Domain) Server :
 ===============================

 What it is : DNS servers responsible for a specific TLD like:
                                                                `.com`
                                                                `.org`
                                                                `.in`

 Role :
 Knows which authoritative DNS servers manage a domain, but this also does NOT store IP addresses

 IT Company Example; Resolver asks `.com` TLD server:
                                                     “Who manages techcorp.com?”
                                                     TLD replies: “These are the authoritative DNS servers for techcorp.com”

 TLD acts like a domain directory.

---

 4. Authoritative DNS Server
=============================
 What it is : The DNS server that owns the DNS records for a domain.

 Role :
 Stores actual DNS records
 Gives the final, trusted answer

 IT Company Example : Authoritative DNS for `techcorp.com` stores:
                                                                    www.techcorp.com → 203.0.113.25
                                                                    mail.techcorp.com → 203.0.113.30
                                                                    Resolver asks: “What is the IP of [www.techcorp.com?”](http://www.techcorp.com?”)
                                                                    Authoritative replies:  “203.0.113.25”

This server is controlled by TechCorp or its DNS provider.

Question: Explain the DNS flow ? *******************VVVVVVIMP
===============================
Answer:
When a user enters a domain name in the browser, the browser first checks its cache, then the OS cache. If not found, the request goes to a DNS resolver. 
The resolver queries the root server to find the TLD server, then queries the TLD server to locate the authoritative DNS server. 
The authoritative server returns the IP address, which is sent back to the resolver and then to the browser, allowing the browser to connect to the server.
