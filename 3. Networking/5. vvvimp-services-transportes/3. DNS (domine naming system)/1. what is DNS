 DNS (Domain Name System) 
 ========================


 What is DNS?
 ==============

DNS (Domain Name System) is a naming system used on computer networks (including the Internet) that translates human-friendly domain names into IP addresses.

Simple definition:  DNS converts domain names (likewww.google.com) into IP addresses (like142.250.190.14) so computers can communicate.

Computers cannot understand domain names.
They only understand numbers (IP addresses).

Example:
Instead of typing: 142.250.190.14
We type: www.google.com

DNS performs this translation automatically and invisibly.



 Real-World Analogy : 

 DNS = Phonebook / Contacts List

| Human World  | Internet World |
---------------------------------
| Person Name  | Domain Name    |
| Phone Number | IP Address     |
| Phonebook    | DNS            |

When you search a contact name, your phone finds the number.
When you type a domain name, DNS finds the IP address.



 What is a Domain Name?
 =========================

A domain name is a human-readable address for a server on the Internet.

Example1: www.example.com

Breakdown:
www → Hostname
example → Domain name
.com → Top Level Domain (TLD)

Example2: grohith@sap.com
grohith → user name 
sap → Domain name
.com → Top Level Domain (TLD)


What is an IP Address?
===========================

An IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network.

Examples:

 IPv4:192.168.1.10
 IPv6:2001:db8::1

DNS maps domain names → IP addresses.
