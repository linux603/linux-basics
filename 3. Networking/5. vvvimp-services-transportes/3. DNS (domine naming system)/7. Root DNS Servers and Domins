 1️⃣ Root DNS Servers
=======================

 What are Root DNS Servers?
-----------------------------
    Root DNS servers are the top most servers in the DNS hierarchy.

    They are the starting point of DNS resolution.

    When a DNS resolver does not know anything about a domain, it first contacts a Root DNS server.



 How many Root DNS servers exist?
---------------------------------
    Logical vs Physical :
    ====================
    Logical Root Servers
    There are 13 logical root DNS servers
    Named from A to M
    A-root, B-root, C-root … M-root
  
    Why only 13?
    Because of early DNS protocol limitations (UDP packet size)
    Each root server name had to fit in a small response

   Physical Root Servers :
   =====================
    Each logical root server has many physical instances
    Deployed worldwide using Anycast
    Total physical instances = hundreds

    👉 This gives:
    High availability
    Load balancing
    Low latency
    DDoS protection



 What is Anycast ?
 ===============
    With Anycast:
    Same IP address is announced from many locations
    User is routed to the nearest instance

    Example:
    You query K-root
    You are in India
    You hit K-root instance in India, not Europe

    Example: K-root in India
    K-root is managed by RIPE NCC
    Has instances in India
    Improves DNS performance for Indian users

What Root DNS Servers DO NOT do
===============================
    ❌ Root servers do not store website IP addresses
    ❌ Root servers do not know [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) IP

 What Root DNS Servers ACTUALLY do
===================================
    They only answer questions like:
    > “Who manages `.com`?”
    > “Who manages `.in`?”

    Example response:
    .com is handled by these TLD servers
    .in is handled by these TLD servers

    They return TLD name server information, not IPs of websites.




 2️⃣ Domain Types:-
================


 What is a Domain?
 -----------------
    A domain name is a human-readable identifier for an IP address.

    Example:
    amazon.com → 54.x.x.x
    Domains are organized hierarchically.

domain types:

 gTLD (Generic Top-Level Domain)
 ==============================
    What is gTLD?
    -------------
    Domains not tied to a country
    Used globally
    Managed by ICANN-accredited registries

    Examples of gTLD:
    ------------------
    | gTLD  | Purpose       |
    -------------------------
    | .com  | Commercial    |
    | .org  | Organizations |
    | .edu  | Education     |
    | .gov  | Government    |
    | .info | Information   |

    Example:
    google.com
    amazon.org
    harvard.edu
    usa.gov

 Why gTLD exists?
 ----------------
    To categorize websites by purpose
    To allow global access without country restriction


ccTLD (Country Code Top-Level Domain)
=====================================

    What is ccTLD?
    -------------
    Domain assigned to a specific country
    Each country manages its own ccTLD

    Examples:

    | Country        | ccTLD |
    --------------------------
    | India          | .in   |
    | United Kingdom | .uk   |
    | United States  | .us   |
    | Pakistan       | .pk   |

    Example:
    gov.in
    bbc.co.uk
    irs.gov.us



 Who manages ccTLD?
 -------------------
 Managed by country-specific authorities
 Example:
   `.in` → NIXI (India)
   `.uk` → Nominet
   `.us` → Neustar


 How Root Servers and TLDs work together
---------------------------------------

DNS Resolver
   ↓
Root Server → “Who manages .com?”
   ↓
TLD Server (.com) → “Who manages amazon.com?”
   ↓
Authoritative Server → “Here is the IP”




 ONE-LINE INTERVIEW ANSWERS

 Root DNS:

> Root DNS servers are the top-level servers that direct DNS resolvers to the appropriate TLD servers and do not store website IP addresses.

 gTLD vs ccTLD:

> gTLDs are generic domains used globally, while ccTLDs are country-specific domains managed by individual countries.
