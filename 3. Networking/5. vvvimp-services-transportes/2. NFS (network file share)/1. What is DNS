NFS (Network File System) 

what is NFS ??? 
=================
NFS is a distributed file system protocol that allows a Linux server to share directories over a network, 
so that other Linux machines can access those directories as if they were local filesystems.



Technical Definition :
=====================

NFS is a client–server based file sharing service where:

One system acts as an NFS server

Other systems act as NFS clients

Files are accessed over the network using TCP port 2049

Remote directories are mounted locally on client machines
