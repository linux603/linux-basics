 VPN or Peering (Private Connectivity)



 🔹 What it is 

VPN or VPC/VNet Peering provides a secure, private connection between two networks.

👉 It connects:

 Cloud ↔ On-premise (VPN)
 Cloud ↔ Cloud (Peering)

Traffic does NOT go over the public internet.



 🔹 Types (Basic Understanding)

 1️⃣ VPN (Hybrid Connectivity)

 Connects on-prem data center to cloud
 Encrypted tunnel over internet

Example:

```
Office Network ↔ VPN ↔ Cloud VPC
```



 2️⃣ VPC / VNet Peering

 Connects two cloud networks privately
 No encryption needed (cloud internal)

Example:

```
VPC-A ↔ Peering ↔ VPC-B
```



 🔹 Why It Is Needed

 1️⃣ Hybrid Cloud

 Access on-prem servers from cloud
 Gradual migration to cloud

 2️⃣ Security

 No public IP exposure
 Private IP communication only



 🔹 Linux Admin Role 

 1️⃣ Access on-prem servers

 SSH to on-prem servers using private IP
 Apps communicate securely across networks



 2️⃣ Debug Routing Issues (Very Important)

If connectivity fails, Linux admin checks:

1️⃣ Correct route exists

ip route


2️⃣ Can reach remote network

ping
traceroute


3️⃣ Firewall allows traffic

 Cloud SG / NSG
 On-prem firewall
 OS firewall

4️⃣ No CIDR overlap

 Overlapping IP ranges break VPN/peering



 🔹 Common Problems (Real World)

❌ Cloud server cannot reach on-prem DB

Reasons:

 Missing route to on-prem CIDR
 Firewall blocking traffic
 Overlapping CIDR ranges



 🔹 Traffic Flow (Easy to Teach)

Cloud VM (10.0.1.10)
      ↓
   VPN / Peering
      ↓
On-prem Server (192.168.1.20)

How Do You Connect Two VPCs?

How can two VPCs communicate with each other?

What are the different ways to connect two VPCs?

How do you enable private connectivity between two VPCs?
=======

anser is single for all questions:


 ✅ Method 1: VPC Peering (Most Common)

 🔹 What it is

A private, direct connection between two VPCs using private IPs.

 🔹 When to use

 Same cloud (AWS↔AWS, Azure↔Azure, GCP↔GCP)
 Low latency
 Simple architecture

 🔹 How it works (Simple Flow)

```
VPC-A (10.0.0.0/16)
   ↕ Peering
VPC-B (10.1.0.0/16)
```

 🔹 Requirements

 No overlapping CIDR
 Route tables updated on both sides
 Security Groups allow traffic

 🔹 Linux Admin Role

 Test connectivity using private IPs

ping
traceroute
ssh

 Debug routing/firewall issues



 ✅ Method 2: VPN (Site-to-Site VPN)

 🔹 What it is

An encrypted tunnel over the internet between two VPCs.

 🔹 When to use

 Cross-cloud (AWS ↔ Azure)
 Temporary or hybrid setup
 Security needed over public internet

 🔹 How it works


VPC-A aws
  ↕ VPN Tunnel (Encrypted)
VPC-B gcp


 🔹 Linux Admin Role

 Verify routes to remote CIDR
 Debug tunnel connectivity
 Check firewall rules



 ✅ Method 3: Transit Gateway / Hub Network (Enterprise)

 🔹 What it is

A central hub that connects multiple VPCs.

 🔹 When to use

 Many VPCs
 Large enterprise architecture

 🔹 Example

```
VPC-A \
VPC-B  Transit Gateway  On-Prem
VPC-C /
```

 🔹 Linux Admin Role

 Rarely configures
 Mostly troubleshoots routing



 ❌ What You CANNOT Use 

 Internet Gateway ❌
 NAT Gateway ❌
 Public IP communication ❌



 🔹 Quick Comparison

| Method          | Secure | Private IP | Use Case             |

| VPC Peering     | ✅      | ✅          | Same cloud           |
| VPN             | ✅      | ✅          | Cross-cloud / Hybrid |
| Transit Gateway | ✅      | ✅          | Large scale          |



Interview One-Line Answer

> Two VPCs can be connected using VPC peering, a site-to-site VPN, or a transit gateway depending on scale and security requirements.





 Who does this: Linux Admin or Network Engineer?

 👉 Answer: BOTH — but with different responsibilities



 🔹 Network Engineer Role (Primary Owner)

Network engineers design and create the connectivity.

They do:

 Create VPC / VNet
 Configure VPC Peering / VPN
 Set CIDR blocks
 Configure Route Tables
 Setup Transit Gateway
 Design network architecture

👉 They BUILD the network



 🔹 Linux Admin Role (Operational Owner)

Linux admins use, validate, and troubleshoot the network.

They do:

 Verify server connectivity
 Test access using private IPs
 Debug routing issues from OS side
-----
ip route
ping
traceroute
-----
 Check Security Groups / NSG
 Check OS firewall
 Report issues to network team

👉 They RUN on the network
