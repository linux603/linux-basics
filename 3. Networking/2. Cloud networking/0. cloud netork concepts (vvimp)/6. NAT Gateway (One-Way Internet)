 NAT Gateway (One-Way Internet)

 🔹 What is a NAT Gateway

A NAT Gateway allows private servers (servers without public IPs) to access the internet, but prevents inbound connections from the internet.

 Think of it as a one-way door:

   Outbound traffic → allowed
   Inbound traffic → blocked

 Private servers remain secure because they are not directly exposed.



 🔹 Why NAT Gateway is Needed

1️⃣ Security best practice

 Private servers (e.g., databases) should not be accessible from the internet
 NAT lets them reach updates or external APIs safely

2️⃣ Outbound internet access

 Servers need to download OS updates, packages, or dependencies

3️⃣ Keep architecture clean

 Public servers handle external traffic
 Private servers handle internal work only



 🔹 Linux Admin Role 

 OS patching

   Update Linux servers in private subnet

  yum update -y    RHEL/CentOS
  apt update && apt upgrade -y    Ubuntu


 Package installation

   Install software from internet repositories

 Connectivity troubleshooting

   If private server cannot reach internet → check NAT Gateway configuration



 🔹 Real-Life Example 

 Private subnet: `10.0.2.0/24` (database servers)
 NAT Gateway in public subnet: allows private servers to download updates
 Result:
   Database gets updates
   Database is not reachable from internet



 🔹 Traffic Flow 

Private Server (10.0.2.10)
       ↓
   NAT Gateway
       ↓
   Internet


 Outbound: ✔ allowed
 Inbound: ✖ blocked



 🔹 One-Line Interview Answer  ********imp

> A NAT Gateway allows servers in private subnets to access the internet securely for updates and package installations, without exposing them to inbound internet traffic.



Private server → NAT → Internet
Inbound blocked → secure
