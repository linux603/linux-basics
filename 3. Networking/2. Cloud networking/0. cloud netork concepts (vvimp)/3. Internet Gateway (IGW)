 Internet Gateway (IGW)

  -->What is an Internet Gateway ?

An Internet Gateway (IGW) is a cloud component that connects your VPC to the internet.

 Without IGW:

 Your cloud network is completely private
 No server can talk to the internet
 No internet can reach your server

Think of IGW as the main door of your cloud network.



  --->Why Internet Gateway is Needed

 Cloud networks are private by default

 When you create a VPC, it has no internet access
 This is done for security

 IGW is added only when you want public access



  --->What IGW Actually Does

 Allows incoming traffic from internet → VPC
 Allows outgoing traffic from VPC → internet
 Works together with:

   Route table
   Public IP

 IGW alone is not enough
(It must be used in routing)



  --->Linux Admin Role (Very Important)

 1️⃣ SSH not working? Check IGW

If Linux admin cannot SSH to server:

 First question: Does VPC have an IGW attached?

No IGW = No SSH (even if server is public)



 2️⃣ Required for public servers

Servers that need IGW:

 Web servers
 Bastion servers
 Jump hosts

Servers that do not need IGW:

 Database servers
 Internal application servers



  --->What IGW Does NOT Do 

 IGW does NOT open ports
 IGW does NOT give public IP
 IGW does NOT control security

 Those are handled by:

 Public IP
 Route table
 Security Group / Firewall



  --->Real-Life 

Company setup:
 Web server in public subnet
 IGW attached to VPC
 Route `0.0.0.0/0` → IGW

Result:
 Users access website from internet

If IGW is removed:
 Website goes down immediately

---> One-Line Interview Answer ***********imp

> An Internet Gateway allows a VPC to communicate with the internet and is required for public-facing servers.





No IGW = No Internet
