Who are your end users of your production services ?


Victoria’s Secret – End Users of Production Services 

“In my previous role supporting an e-commerce environment similar to Victoria’s Secret, our production services were used by two major groups:

### 1. External End Users (Primary)

* Millions of global retail customers accessing the website and mobile app
* Users browsing the catalog, adding items to cart, checking out, and tracking orders
* Peak-season high-traffic customers (Black Friday, Holiday sales)

### 2. Internal Business Teams

* Merchandising & Inventory teams using internal dashboards
* Marketing & Promotions team managing product launches and campaigns
* Order management, fulfillment, and logistics team
* Customer care team, relying on CS tools integrated with production APIs
* Engineering & product teams consuming microservices internally

I ensured stability, uptime, scalability, and performance for services that directly impacted revenue, checkout flows, page load times, and overall customer shopping experience.”
